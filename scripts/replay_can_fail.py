"""Replay every belief's proof: mutate the guarded code, run the owning tests, demand RED.

`beliefs/*.toml` names, per documented control, the tests that own it and one mutation
(file, find, replace) that removes the control. A test that stays green under that mutation
proves nothing about the control (docs/TESTING.md said "every control has a test that goes
red without it"; before this script that sentence was prose). Borrowed from the ai-gateway's
beliefs layer, cut to what a repository this size needs: no provenance vocabulary, no shards.

    python3 scripts/replay_can_fail.py             # every belief
    python3 scripts/replay_can_fail.py --belief X  # one
    python3 scripts/replay_can_fail.py --list

Each belief: the owning tests run once unmutated and must pass (a red baseline is not
evidence about the mutation), then the file is mutated, the tests run again and must fail,
and the file is restored on every exit, signals included. With --jobs 1 the replay owns this
working tree for its length; with more (the default: one per CPU, up to 8, or
MAISECRETS_REPLAY_JOBS) each worker replays in a private copy and this tree is never mutated.
Never run it inside the test suite.
