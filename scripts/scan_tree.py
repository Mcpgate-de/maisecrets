"""The repository must not carry a value the detector would hide: scan every file on its own.

The CI job used to pipe all files into one `maisecrets.cli scan`. A PNG in the tree crashed the
strict decode without output, which read as "nothing found" for weeks, and one long stream let
a label at the end of one file pair with the first word of the next (2026-09-27). Each file is
read as bytes, decoded with replacement, and scanned alone; a hit prints the path, the line and
the rule, never the value.
