description: Show what maisecrets is and does on this machine - version, plugin folder, Python, store, policy, counts. No value is printed.
allowed-tools: Bash(bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run.sh" status), PowerShell(& "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run.cmd" status)
---

Run exactly this command and show the user its output as is, then stop:

```
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run.sh" status
```

On Windows without bash (PowerShell: the ChatGPT app, Codex on Windows, Claude Code without Git Bash), run this instead:

```
& "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run.cmd" status
```

If `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is still written like that when the command runs, put `$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` in its place. If that is empty too (Codex on Windows), use the folder of the newest version: `Split-Path (Split-Path (Get-ChildItem "$HOME\.codex\plugins\cache\*\maisecrets\*\hooks\run.cmd" | Sort-Object LastWriteTime | Select-Object -Last 1).FullName)`. Codex on Windows runs the command in its sandbox as another user, who may not write this user's maisecrets folder or read its vault. If the command fails there (`no write access`, access denied, or the message that Python is missing), run the same command once more outside the sandbox, with escalated permissions, and give the reason "maisecrets reads the store of this user".
