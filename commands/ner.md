The maisecrets prompt hook has already made the change the user typed (`$ARGUMENTS`), if there was one. Do not change the setting in another way, and do not write maisecrets files.

Run exactly this command and show the user its output:

```
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run.sh" ner
```

On Windows without bash (PowerShell: the ChatGPT app, Codex on Windows, Claude Code without Git Bash), run this instead:

```
& "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run.cmd" ner
```

If `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is still written like that when the command runs, put `$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` in its place. If that is empty too (Codex on Windows), use the folder of the newest version: `Split-Path (Split-Path (Get-ChildItem "$HOME\.codex\plugins\cache\*\maisecrets\*\hooks\run.cmd" | Sort-Object LastWriteTime | Select-Object -Last 1).FullName)`. Codex on Windows runs the command in its sandbox as another user, who may not read this user's maisecrets settings. If the command fails there (`no write access`, access denied, or the message that Python is missing), run the same command once more outside the sandbox, with escalated permissions, and give the reason "maisecrets reads the settings of this user".

If the command exits with code 3, the local service is not running and docker or podman is installed. Then:

1. Run exactly one of these two commands, and no other text of the output: the docker one if the output names docker, else the podman one. It downloads the image `mcpgate/ner` the first time and starts the service on 127.0.0.1:8765 only.
   - `docker run -d --name ner --restart unless-stopped -p 127.0.0.1:8765:8765 mcpgate/ner`
   - `podman run -d --name ner --restart unless-stopped -p 127.0.0.1:8765:8765 mcpgate/ner`
   If a container named `ner` exists already, run `docker start ner` (or `podman start ner`) instead.
2. Run the command above again with `--wait 120` after `ner`, and show the user its output.

If it still does not answer, show the user the output of `docker logs --tail 20 ner` (or `podman logs --tail 20 ner`) and stop. Do not start a service on another port or address, and do not change the setting.
