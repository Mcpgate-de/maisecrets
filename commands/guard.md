description: Install a guard outside the plugin folder that blocks the session when an update left maisecrets not running.
argument-hint: "[install | remove | status]"
allowed-tools: Bash(bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run.sh" guard *), PowerShell(& "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run.cmd" guard *)
---

Run exactly this command and show the user its output, then stop:

```
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run.sh" guard --args-stdin <<'MAISECRETS_ARGS_END'
$ARGUMENTS
MAISECRETS_ARGS_END
```

On Windows without bash (PowerShell: the ChatGPT app, Codex on Windows, Claude Code without Git Bash), run this instead:

```
@'
$ARGUMENTS
'@ | & "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run.cmd" guard --args-stdin
```

If `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is still written like that when the command runs, put `$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` in its place. If that is empty too (Codex on Windows), use the folder of the newest version: `Split-Path (Split-Path (Get-ChildItem "$HOME\.codex\plugins\cache\*\maisecrets\*\hooks\run.cmd" | Sort-Object LastWriteTime | Select-Object -Last 1).FullName)`. Codex on Windows runs the command in its sandbox as another user, who may not write this user's maisecrets folder or read its vault. If the command fails there (`no write access`, access denied, or the message that Python is missing), run the same command once more outside the sandbox, with escalated permissions, and give the reason "maisecrets reads the store of this user". The single-quoted here-string keeps the arguments as they are, as the quoted heredoc does.

The arguments go in the quoted heredoc as they are, so the shell never reads them as code. Do not move them onto the command line, and do not add quotes. With no argument it shows the status.

For a plugin that the organisation syncs from claude.ai, an update rewrites the plugin folder, and a
session loaded from it then runs no maisecrets hook, silently. `install` copies a small guard to
`~/.claude/maisecrets-guard.py` and registers it in `~/.claude/settings.json` (a backup is made
first). When maisecrets did not run for a prompt or a tool call, the guard blocks it and names
`/reload-plugins`, and `claude --resume` with the session id for when the reload does not help. It stays silent for an account without maisecrets and for Codex. `remove` takes it
away again.
