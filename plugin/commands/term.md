description: Your term lists - names, case numbers and customer names that maisecrets masks. Add one with /maisecrets:term add NAME, remove one with /maisecrets:term remove NAME (as your own prompt). No term is printed.
argument-hint: "[add NAME | remove NAME]"
allowed-tools: Bash(bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run.sh" terms), PowerShell(& "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run.cmd" terms)
---

Run exactly this command and show the user its output as is, then stop:

```
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run.sh" terms
```

On Windows without bash (PowerShell: the ChatGPT app, Codex on Windows, Claude Code without Git Bash), run this instead:

```
& "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run.cmd" terms
```

If `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is still written like that when the command runs, put `$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` in its place. If that is empty too (Codex on Windows), use the folder of the newest version: `Split-Path (Split-Path (Get-ChildItem "$HOME\.codex\plugins\cache\*\maisecrets\*\hooks\run.cmd" | Sort-Object LastWriteTime | Select-Object -Last 1).FullName)`. Codex on Windows runs the command in its sandbox as another user, who may not read this user's maisecrets folder. If the command fails there (`no write access`, access denied, or the message that Python is missing), run the same command once more outside the sandbox, with escalated permissions, and give the reason "maisecrets reads the term lists of this user".

The maisecrets prompt hook answers `/maisecrets:term add NAME` and `/maisecrets:term remove NAME` itself, before this command runs, because the prompt carries the name. Do not add or remove a term in another way, and do not write maisecrets files: if the user wants a change, tell them the prompt to send.
