"""The detect-secrets adapter (Yelp, Apache-2.0). It runs in a new process of the Python that
BENCH_DETECT_SECRETS_PYTHON names (an environment with `pip install detect-secrets==1.5.0`), else this Python.

Each case is written to a file at its path (else input.txt) and scanned with `detect_secrets.core.scan.scan_file`
under the default settings (all plugins, the default filters), as `detect-secrets scan` does, but before
`SecretsCollection` keeps one entry per value and type: a value found on two lines is two findings. One plugin
reports a value once per line, so a value twice on one line is one finding (a limit of the tool, not of the
adapter). A finding is a secret value it reports; its offset is the place of that value in its line (a value
reported twice on a line goes to its first and its second place). Every plugin of detect-secrets finds secrets, so
its scope is `secret.`."""
