# block or pass it: a report that quoted a value of the right shape stopped the session until the person
# pasted it again (2026-09-29, twice in one review). The text was written by a model of this session, so
# every value in it was in a model's context already, and blocking it protects nothing. The hook payload
# has no origin field (Claude Code 2.1.284), so the report proves itself: one notification block, a tool
# use id that this session's transcript gives to an Agent or SendMessage call, an output file in this
# session's subagents folder, and a result equal to that subagent's last answer. A background command reports
# the same way, and its summary is the command (or its description) as the model wrote it: a block lost the
# notice, and the session waited for a command that had ended (2026-10-26). It passes when the summary equals
# that Bash call of this transcript and the output file is in this session's tasks folder. A typed or pasted
# text and a monitor event do not pass, and no value outside the model's text passes (docs/THREAT-MODEL.md C19).
