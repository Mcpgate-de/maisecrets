"""Values from your own tools: imports of found values, masked wherever they appear (README "Values from your own
tools", C26, #19 part 3).

A tool the person runs (a NER, an export, a script) writes JSON lines:

    {"value": "Jan Kowalski", "type": "NAME"}
    {"value": "jan.kowalski@example.org", "type": "EMAIL"}
    {"value": "A value without a shape"}            # type SECRET when it is missing

`maisecrets values import FILE`, or a file of the setting `value_files` at session start, adds them to an import:
`~/.maisecrets/imports/<id>.jsonl`, written by maisecrets alone (value_files.py). The registry pass `imports`
(registry phase 5, after the terms) finds every imported value as a phrase of whole words, in any case, NFC and
without format characters, with the matcher of the terms (terms.Matcher): one index of every import, never a regex
per value. A hit is a detect.Match of kind `import:<import id>:<value id>`, so it names its import.

Mask only, as the terms: the store keeps `maisecrets-import:<ids>`, never the value, and the placeholder is never
put back into a command or a file. An imported value that a rule finds, or that the store holds already, keeps
that rule's or that entry's placeholder (detect._import_hits, hooks._longest_wins): an import only adds masking
where nothing else masks, and never changes how another value is masked or resolved.

The trust rule: the agent can only make detection stricter. An import only adds. Nothing in a line can loosen
anything: only `value` and `type` are read, and a type only names the placeholder. A new import of the same file
merges into its import and never drops a value; only the person removes an import, by a typed prompt
(/maisecrets:forget import:ID, hooks.user_prompt). What an agent can still do is mask too much, and these hold it:

- a floor per value (_reason): at least MIN_LEN characters, a number at least MIN_DIGITS digits, no ordinary word
  (one word of lower-case letters, or only words of the stop list of the team terms), no text of maisecrets itself.
- caps: MAX_PER_IMPORT values in one import, MAX_VALUES in all, of which the imports that no value file names hold
  at most MAX_RUN_VALUES, so the person's value files always have room; MAX_IMPORTS imports.
- each new import is named at the next session start, by id and count, and /maisecrets:list shows every import.
