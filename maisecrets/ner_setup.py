"""/maisecrets:ner: one source of names for tool results (setting `remote_detector`, maisecrets/remote_layer.py).

    /maisecrets:ner local          the service on this computer, http://127.0.0.1:8765/ (`on` is the same)
    /maisecrets:ner url URL        a service of the team on a private network
    /maisecrets:ner off            the rules alone
    /maisecrets:ner                which source is set, and whether it answers

Codex: `maisecrets: ner local` (or url URL, off) alone as the prompt. The change is a setting, so only a prompt the
person typed makes it (settings.py), with the limits of C22 (docs/THREAT-MODEL.md); a tool call that carries the
sentence is refused. Exactly one source: a
fallback to another one would send the text somewhere the person did not choose. A source that does not answer
leaves the rules alone, as before. The tuning keys of the setting (timeout_ms, classes, min_score, max_chars,
language) stay when the source changes.

A service that is not on this computer gets every finding of the rules as filler (remote.py), and the text of the
tool result goes there: a team decides that, not a default.
