"""Rules of your own: detection rules from folders, and an allow list (README "Rules of your own", C25).

The sources, read once per process (detect.rules() keeps the result):

- `~/.maisecrets/rules.d`, the person's own folder. The agent cannot write there (C8).
- each folder of the setting `rule_dirs`; only a prompt the person typed adds or removes one (C22).
- each folder of `rule_dirs` in the machine policy; the person cannot remove those.

A folder holds `*.json` (the gitleaks form of rules/own_secret_rules.json) and `*.prefixes` (the line form of
rules/prefixes.txt, `id  regex`). When it has a subfolder `rules/`, that subfolder is read instead (a team repository
keeps its rules there), and maisecrets/terms.py reads `*.terms` there (a team term list with a floor). Nothing else
is read: no code, no allow list, no symbolic link, no git metadata.
A folder is data that a hook reads in every call, so each rule passes checks at load; a rule that fails one is
QUARANTINED: it is left out, and /maisecrets:rules, the status and events.log name it with its reason. A refused rule
is named by its place (`rule 3`, `line 7`), never by a text of its own: a refused line can be a pasted value. A broken
rule file or folder never stops a hook and never costs the rules of another folder. A broken machine policy still
does (vault.load_config).

The checks: a literal of 4 characters; at most 300 characters of regex; no shape that backtracks (a repeat inside a
repeat, a repeat of something that can be empty, branches that start alike inside a repeat, two repeats in a row that
take the same characters, a backreference); no quantifier at the start. Then each new rule runs once on test texts
that make a backtracking regex slow (a child process that is ended at PROBE_DEADLINE); a rule slower than
PROBE_LIMIT_MS is quarantined. The verdicts are kept in `.rules-state` by a hash of the rule, so a hook pays for the
checks once per rule. A rule that is still too slow in a real scan (detect.USER_RULE_BUDGET), or that runs when the
hook's watchdog answers, is quarantined there too, from the next call on.

The allow list only loosens, so only the person (`~/.maisecrets/allow.txt`) and the administrator (`allow` in the
policy) write it: one exact value per line, or `rule: <id>` to switch a rule off. Never a pattern: a pattern in an allow
list lets through values nobody looked at. A folder of rule_dirs carries no allow list: an agent can write a shared
checkout, and an agent may only make detection stricter.
