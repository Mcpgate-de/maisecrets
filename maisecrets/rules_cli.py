_README = """# Detection rules for maisecrets

maisecrets reads the rules in `rules/` in addition to its own. To use them, clone this repository and type this as
your own prompt in Claude Code, with the folder you cloned it to:

    /maisecrets:settings rule_dirs add {path}

In Codex, send this alone as your prompt: `maisecrets: set rule_dirs add {path}`

`/maisecrets:rules` then shows the folder and how many rules it loaded.

- `rules/*.json`: rules in the gitleaks form (`id`, `regex`, `keywords`, `entropy`, `secretGroup`, `allowlists`).
- `rules/*.prefixes`: one rule per line, `id  regex`; the whole match is the secret.
- `samples.txt`: `hit <rule-id> <text>` must be found by that rule, `miss <text>` by none.

Check a change before you commit it: `maisecrets rules check .` (the CI files here run the same).

A rule needs a keyword or a literal of 4 characters and at most 300 characters of regex. It must not backtrack: no
repeat inside a repeat, no quantifier at the start, no two repeats in a row that take the same characters. Each rule
is also timed on test texts; a rule slower than 50 ms is left out. A folder holds at most 500 rules, a file at most
64 KB. A rule that fails a check is left out, not the folder.

No names, no customer data and no real values in here. A rule describes a shape; the samples use made-up values.
