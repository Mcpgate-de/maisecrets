"""The rule registry: where each detection rule comes from, its rank, its channel, its region and its class, as data.

detect.rules() was a sum of loaders in a fixed order, and the first rule to claim a span wins: the order decided which
rule id a hit gets, and the id decides what scan() and the vault do with it (a label rule in test code is a fixture, a
label hit is stored quiet). A measurement of the order (2026-10-15) found ten such dependencies between the sources.
Here each rule gets a RuleSpec with an explicit rank, `priority = (phase, band, seq)`, and detect.rules() sorts by it.

- `phase` orders the passes of a scan: 0 the password export, 1 the rule list, 2 the personal-data step and the
  cleaned copy of a tool result, 3 the rules of your own, 4 the extra matchers.
- `band` is the source inside the rule list (BANDS), with gaps for a source to come.
- `seq` is the position in the source file.

The rule id (`Match.kind`) stays what it was: the vault index and the event log store it. Three ids are loaded twice
(mailchimp-api-key, new-relic-insert-key, flutterwave-secret-key), so each spec also gets a unique `key`
(`<source>:<id>`). Standard library only; Python 3.9.

This module is what a hook reads: the bands, the phases and the functions that mark a rule. The spec itself, the patch
records and the upstream digests are in maisecrets/rulespec.py, which loads only when a spec is asked for
(`maisecrets rules list`, the tests, the measurement scripts): three frozen dataclasses cost about 3 ms at import, and
a hook pays every millisecond. Their names are still read here (registry.RuleSpec, registry.make, ...).
