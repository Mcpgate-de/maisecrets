"""Rehydration: when a placeholder becomes its real value in a tool call.

Two layers, kept apart on purpose.

Capability (maisecrets/hooks.py, not configurable): can the value go into this call as data,
away from the model? A shell context the rewrite cannot place, a command word that would parse
or encode the value, a remote shell after ssh, a placeholder used as a JSON key, a write into the
maisecrets home, a path a client does not support: each is refused, whatever the policy says.

Policy (this module): for a path that can take the value, does maisecrets add its own confirm?

  automatic  the default. maisecrets adds no confirm. Claude Code: the hook returns no
             permission decision, so the user's own permission rules decide. Codex: the hook
             returns "allow", the only decision that carries a rewritten input there.
  confirm    the user confirms each call. Claude Code: "ask", which also holds in auto mode.
             Codex cannot ask with a rewritten input, so the call is refused.
  block      the value is never put in; the call is refused before anything is resolved.

Whatever the policy, the value stays out of the model: the rewritten input goes to the tool, not
into the context, and the transcript scrub, the session rule, the limiter and the audit line
apply on every path.
