"""The remote detector in the plugin (setting `remote_detector`; docs/DETECTION.md, "A remote detector"). Off
unless the setting names a URL. Tool results here; a typed prompt only through the mod's rewrite in Claude Code and
only to a service on this computer (hooks._prompt_names): a name never blocks a prompt.

One request per hook call. A tool result is many strings (a JSON result is walked leaf by leaf), and a request per
string let one call wait 1.6 s against a budget of 0.3 s in the NER experiment (docs/NER-EXPERIMENT.md, B5). So
before the walk, `prepare` scans each string with the rules, joins the strings into one text, asks the service once
within `timeout_ms`, and hands each string its spans back. The walk then takes the findings from here and scans
nothing twice.

A finding of the service is stored like any other, so its placeholder resolves, but it is weak (vault.is_weak): it is
masked where the model found it and never hunted in other texts. A false name such as "Build" then costs one mask.
