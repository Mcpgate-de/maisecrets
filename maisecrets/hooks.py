"""Hook handlers for Claude Code (and, with an adapter, Codex).

Every handler reads one JSON payload from stdin and prints one JSON object.
It never prints a value. It fails closed: an error inside a handler blocks
the action it guards, and says so.

Events:
  user-prompt  UserPromptSubmit  -> block + store + clipboard on a hit
  pre-tool     PreToolUse        -> rehydrate ⟦REF⟧ in Bash commands
  post-tool    PostToolUse       -> redact tool results before the model sees them
  post-tool-failure PostToolUseFailure -> a failed call's output cannot be replaced: store, clean, tell
