"""Where each stored secret was sent (setting `secret_destinations`: observe by default, or off).
Mcpgate-de/maisecrets#13.

Observe only: this module never decides whether a call runs. It notes, on this computer only, each destination a
stored secret went to, and shows it in /maisecrets:list. A seen destination is a record, never a permission: `seen`
and `allowed` are kept apart in the store, and `allowed` is not used by any decision yet (a later protect mode).

Destinations:
- network: a host from a URL in a Bash command, an ssh host (as maisecrets/ssh_consent.py reads it), an MCP server
  and tool. The tool, not the server, because one gateway server carries many services, one tool each; an `action`
  is the operation inside a service, not a destination (scripts/measure_binding.py, 2026-10-07: with `action` in the
  key 16 of 56 secrets would have several destinations, with server and tool 5). A tool that serves several services
  names its service in a `service` or `provider` field, which then joins the key.
- local: a file (Write, Edit) or a Bash command without a host. Listed, never a destination, never a hint.
A label is cleaned (one printable line, a secret shape hidden, a service field only as a name), and the record of a
secret keeps its MAX_PER_SECRET most recent destinations.

The one hint (maisecrets/settings.py HINTS) comes at the first pattern break: a secret with ESTABLISHED_USES uses on
one day at one network destination goes to a network destination it never went to. 3 uses on one day was measured
as the threshold (scripts/measure_binding.py over 90 days of one user's transcripts: 1/1 gave 56 breaks, 2/1 18,
3/1 8, 3/2 1, 5/2 0); a stricter one would almost never fire, a looser one counts the setup of a new token.
