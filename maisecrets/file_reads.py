"""Reads of PDFs and images: what the person decides with the settings read_pdf and read_image.

maisecrets cannot look inside an image or a PDF: the client sends its bytes to the model, and a scan of the base64
text finds nothing real (a 1 MB image took 30 s and gave one false hit, which also broke the image). So the person
decides per type (C28):

    allow    the file goes to the model as it is (the default; a hint names the setting once)
    ask      Claude Code asks the person first; Codex cannot ask, so it refuses with a hint
    block    the read is refused
    convert  PDF only: the PDF never reaches the model. The text that `pdftotext` extracts on this computer takes
             its place, and the normal redaction masks it.

The shapes are measured (Claude Code 2.1.296, harness/probe_file_reads.py, goldens in harness/golden/). PreToolUse
gets the path; PostToolUse gets {type: "image" | "pdf" | "parts", file: {...}}. Only an answer in the shape of a
text Read removes the image or the PDF from the request: a string fails the client's shape check and the original
is sent, and a PDF-shaped answer with an empty base64 still sends the whole PDF. So every answer here that stands in
for a PDF or an image is `text_result()`, also a refusal. Folders in the list setting clean_dirs are the person's
own decision: a file there that was in place before the session passes as allow. A Bash result that the client
marks isImage (its stdout is a data:image URI) reaches the model as an image; it counts as an image read, and only
its stdout skips the scan. Only the client's own isImage counts: a text that only starts like a data URI is text,
and is scanned as text. A notebook Read whose outputs hold an image counts as an image read too: ask and block send
it as text without the images. A pasted image and an image in an MCP result never reach this module (known gaps,
README).
