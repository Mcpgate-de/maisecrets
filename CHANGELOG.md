# Changelog

## Unreleased

## [0.9.10] - 2026-11-14

### Features

- finds a password and an id number after a key in JSON, XML, HTML tables and SQL, also short ones (eff0c79)
- finds an id after a health, tax or policy label in prose, bold labels and table cells, also a short id with a letter prefix (599136d)
- finds a person's name after a name key in JSON, XML, HTML tables and SQL, also with a gender suffix (16d2948)
- /maisecrets:ner shows the load of the gateway's name service and your quota this minute (7fa5b8f)
- the local name service gets a share of the computer, not all of it (3055d5b)
- the load of the container maisecrets started is read with its own metrics bearer (58ae3e5)
- /maisecrets:ner shows the load of the name service from its /metrics (6480192)
- /maisecrets:ner gateway URL starts the login itself when the login lacks the name scope (a3296dd)
- your prompts can go to the gateway's name service too, and each unchecked tool result says so on your screen (479cfa3)
- the gateway of your login can find the names in tool results (/maisecrets:ner gateway URL) (1249b18)

### Fixes

- an insurance policy number is no longer read as a personal id; the release gate counted 207 false alarms in insurance documents (b92d357)
- a generic document or id number counts in a person's element or next to the type of a person's document, not near any word; a label and its id in parentheses in prose (Gate A round 2) (90783fb)
- a document or id number of an invoice or an order stays text, a password in any element is a password, and sin (31415), a firewall policy and a year stay text (Gate A) (b72a500)
- a password after a key passes the checks of a password literal, and a joined expression, a reference of your sources and a fixture stay text; one prefilter per family (dbac1e9)
- the launch of a subagent is found in one pass over the transcript (b772db6)
- a subagent report without a tool use id passes only when this session started or resumed that agent (a36ffbd)
- a subagent's report without a tool use id is no longer blocked as a typed prompt (c1da0e2)
- a settings command with a name marked with {{…}} or a name the name service finds is not sent either (3429a0c)
- a settings command that carries a value changes nothing and is not sent, and forget takes a placeholder in brackets whole (0a00526)
- every line that starts with a slash goes to the settings hook unchanged, also /plugin:dir:cmd and non-ASCII names (72c7ebd)
- a person-name key inside the element of a thing, such as a security's fullName, stays text (0a44021)
- the name-key rule leaves a placeholder last name alone, and a sort order or the key word as the value (36170ea)
- a word like Long or Short inside a name no longer stops the name-key rule; legal_full_name is no person key (e0605c5)
- the name-key rule also takes a role before the key, a double surname, YAML comments and HTML cells on their own lines (771b03d)
- the local container never asks for more CPUs than the container engine has, and the load lines end in time (f50e677)
- a busy gateway that answers 429 with error busy counts as busy, not as the quota (06a0d9b)
- the AI knows at each result that its names were not checked, and sref login takes the server of the name gateway (6c27409)
- a name source that cannot be asked says so on your screen too, and a program's prompt never goes to the network (1d80c9f)

### Security

- a value in the arguments of a slash command is blocked again, not passed to the model (f6a520d)

### Dependencies

- the local name service follows mcpgate/ner v2.0.3916, which has /metrics and names its release (02e5abf)

## [0.9.9] - 2026-11-13

### Features

- the first start and a daily tip name /maisecrets:secret-hygiene for secrets that leaked before maisecrets ran (b828d3e)

### Fixes

- a company after an account holder key in JSON is no person name (c33374b)
- a legal form drops a name only after an account holder label and in its usual spelling (cda4db6)
- a name followed by a legal form after a holder label is a company, and the bank-block rule reads Windows line ends and name particles (213a750)
- a name on the line above a bank block, and a name after Kontoinhaber:, is masked in tool results (4ddf55f)
- the plugin directory reads the mod: one file, and a sent prompt hides values a click opened (23078f9)

## [0.9.8] - 2026-11-13

### Fixes

- button words such as "Allow" and "Deny" are no longer masked as person names, and callers get the whole no-person rule (2bcad91)
- a person name under assignee, reporter or another role key of API data is masked, also a one-word name (616c114)
- one ordinary word in a sentence after "the secret:" or "le secret:" is no longer masked (a5da45b)

## [0.9.7] - 2026-11-12

- the PyPI package installs the command maisecrets-detect and ships the rules once (ed7b99f)
- a date and time with dots in a mail message id is no longer masked as an IP address (dd2e885)
- a stored product name or English word no longer masks that word in every later tool result (2b4cee0)

### Dependencies

- update dependency betterleaks/betterleaks to v1.10.0 (fcf239f)

## [0.9.6] - 2026-11-11

### Features

- detects 17 more secrets that stand alone: Infisical, Bitwarden Secrets Manager, Gitpod, dbt Cloud, Convex, DeepSeek and Anyscale tokens, private keys as one base64 line, passwords in ODBC, Go MySQL and Oracle connection strings, and the password of a Wi-Fi QR code (7d9004d)
- detects 16 more token formats that stand alone, among them AWS STS session tokens, Google OAuth refresh tokens, Slack refresh tokens and k3s join tokens (365845d)
- a token format is one line `id  PREFIX  REST`; maisecrets adds the edges (cf082f1)
- Detector.label_changes_a_number(label) says whether a label adds a finding to a number or takes one away (b786778)
- findings_by_leaf(numbers=True) finds a card stored as a number in the same scans (a207a40)
- detects a Bitbucket OAuth consumer secret (ATOA…) that stands alone, without a label (299a127)

### Fixes

- a short text walks only the rules its alphabet allows; a metric series of 2,680 numbers scans 4 times faster (818c2fc)

## [0.9.5] - 2026-11-10

### Fixes

- the start of a hook compiles the pattern of a gateway login command only when it is used (46cf0c6)
- the first hint names NER only where docker or podman can start it, and else how to add a missed name (d7aa19a)
- the lock now says what the AI never saw, and the start line says that plain text is known to the AI and how to find names with NER (66cfbbf)
- maisecrets.__version__ names the version of the installed package or plugin (d45deb0)
- the account of a gateway login is shown to you only, not to the AI (d627f7b)

## [0.9.4] - 2026-11-09

### Fixes

- a gateway's display with a hidden character or a clear value is not drawn on the screen (95bfc24)
- a config or a system locale with a country without rules no longer stops the detector (12ba408)
- the short password of a URL before a host with a dot is masked again (f78b113)
- an escaped emoji no longer stops the name service for a whole tool result (d183714)
- a gateway reference on the screen is labelled with the display the gateway gave, not with the AI's text (3e9e88f)
- the hint tells the AI to write a gateway reference whole too, so the person can click it (a8e239e)
- a stored name of two words or more is replaced in any case, so "joachim demo" finds the stored "Joachim Demo" (1ebb171)
- the name service reads a JSON-escaped text with its escapes as characters, so names after \r\n are found (a634b48)
- finds an e-mail address as a percent-encoded segment of a URL path, and one with the JSON escape of its @ (a56fe3d)
- finds an e-mail address with an underscore, hyphens or a phone number glued to its end (c24bd88)
- the PyPI page names the command line entry point, and the package lists Python 3.9 to 3.15 (0c76b4a)
- the password of a URL before a host with a dot is a secret, not an e-mail address (7092691)
- finds an IBAN with no-break spaces between its groups (4b659a0)
- masks a name after the German label Kontaktperson:, as after contact person: (cb6f9da)
- masks the whole name after a German salutation with a title (Sehr geehrter Herr Dr. <first name> <surname>) (539cf91)
- an unknown region, label language or channel raises ValueError with the known codes (6433ffe)
- findings_with() stops the scan of the rules at its deadline, as findings() does (a68c7b9)
- a logged hit no longer shows its value: repr() and str() of a Match name its rule, type, offsets and length (a62968b)
- a refused login names the command that fixes it, and a click's message no longer says "maisecrets:" twice (0128b15)

## [0.9.3] - 2026-11-09

### Features

- /maisecrets:sref status and the login name the masked account of the login (a909319)

### Fixes

- a log timestamp after an id label is no longer masked as an identity number (09d851f)
- only a reference a gateway gave this session is left alone by detection and replacement (da94300)
- finds a password in a table column without the Markdown separator row, in a tab table, and under a secret, token or PIN header (6733abf)
- hides the passcode in a Microsoft Teams join link (12a5be0)
- the login takes the scope of each sink from the gateway's sinks map (a7e49e8)
- the note about the name service says why it gave no result (no answer in time, text too long, not running) (b402f10)
- a secret of your store is never drawn either; its placeholder stays with a lock, and a click copies it (5a80aec)
- a gateway secret is never drawn on the screen; one click copies it (d7cc054)
- a value stored from a reference id by 0.9.1 no longer breaks the reference at the next read (379ccb6)

## [0.9.2] - 2026-11-08

### Fixes

- commands keep their values when the gateway lists the command sink as "process-1" (36567d3)
- a gateway reference after a label such as "token:" stays whole in a tool result (ee3141e)

## [0.9.1] - 2026-11-08

### Features

- the session start says that values with a lock are on your screen only; Claude sees placeholders (fc2124b)
- the call and result of an MCP tool or any other tool show your values on your screen too (45fe01e)
- your own prompt shows the values you typed, with the lock, on your screen only (754f4a5)
- a click on a gateway reference shows its value on your screen, and a second click copies it; /maisecrets:sref says what the login allows (7a80b0b)

### Fixes

- a term from your term list keeps its placeholder on the screen (d7c1a43)
- an MCP call that gets a stored value asks you instead of being refused (d7f7053)
- review of 0.9.1: a link without :// keeps its placeholder, a reveal follows a new session, and the guards of the tool rows are tested (d045ada)
- the AI is told to keep a placeholder whole when it shows one, so you see the value on your screen (43d6051)
- the plugin syncs to a claude.ai organisation again: old benchmark baselines leave the tree, which stays under 150 MB (7d1852e)
- a failed command that printed a stored value no longer shows it to the AI in Claude Code (e6cb41c)
- a link the AI writes can no longer copy a value: each copy link carries a random part only the drawing holds (eefc0d4)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-11-08

### Features

- a Sensitive Reference in a Bash command gets its value again, with a login that allows commands; a refused one names the gateway's reason (1761905)
- values show on your screen with a lock in Claude Code and the desktop app, never for the AI; a click copies one (setting show_values) (90c28f9)
- a phone number in more German sentences is masked: office hours before unter, the verb at the end, unter der Nummer, unter:, Rückrufe unter (c5df62b)
- the local name service gets the image a plugin update pins, at the next session start (05ce1be)

### Fixes

- a value that starts with the refusal marker is never printed; the reason goes out with printf (24bde99)
- a value never stands in a link or URL the AI wrote, so a click cannot send it away (0afc5a4)
- the German call-cue scan takes linear time on a long run of spaces, and the Figma exception needs a field only Figma has (7abcaec)
- the key of a Figma file, component or style in a Figma answer is no longer masked as an API key (9b44348)
- a German tax id under the display name "Steuer ID" (with a space) is found (a85cd46)
- a change taken back before its release is no longer listed in the release notes (a023360)

## [0.8.30] - 2026-11-08

### API

- leaves.label: a digit-only string segment counts as a list index (changed) (5252f14)
- Detector.label_names_a_number(label) -> bool (new) (c3363be)

### Features

- a caller can ask whether a field label can make a number personal data (c3363be)

### Fixes

- leaves.label skips a list index given as a string (phones.0 is labelled phones) (5252f14)
- a content digest (sha256:…, or an image pinned by it) after a secret or token label is no longer masked (c1d03fc)
- /maisecrets:ner names the requests of sessions of an older version instead of calling them unknown (7c4339c)

- a card number right after a UUID is found (b5ee985)

## [0.8.27] - 2026-11-07

### Fixes

- finds a phone number that an API keeps in its international form without the + (b4bd1be)

## [0.8.26] - 2026-11-07

### Fixes

- finds a phone number in more API field shapes and before a series of numbers, a surname after Mr or Ms, and two more e-mail forms (2994b27)
- finds an IPv6 address after a colon or before a dotted port, and judges a wrapped IPv4 by the address it carries (8af1a63)
- the name service gets time for a long tool result, and ner.log says why it did not answer (af9a100)
- a command that prints a value from a server and fails no longer shows it to the AI (118f50a)
- a value a server gave stays masked while the session works, and goes when it ends (51e7ba1)
- two sessions that renew the gateway login at once keep it (c1ecdf5)
- ms:( names a test value as one, not as ordinary text (bc7f4a6)

## [0.8.25] - 2026-11-06

### Fixes

- a scan with a deadline now stops within one hit after it, also when your References callback is slow (09ba5c5)
- an address or other value a server gave you comes back as the same Sensitive Reference when a command prints it, and is not stored on this computer (e907752)

## [0.8.24] - 2026-11-05

### Features

- a record scan that stops at its deadline names the strings it read whole (0722903)
- a scan can stop at a deadline and return what it found so far (3c74643)
- tells you once per session when a gateway offers Sensitive References and this computer has no login (5963c3c)

## [0.8.23] - 2026-11-05

### Fixes

- /maisecrets:sref runs again (3aae54e)
- finds a password like Sommer2024! after the German word Passwort or Kennwort in a tool result (4a8f626)

## [0.8.21] - 2026-11-04

### Fixes

- fewer false alarms in code and docs: an ordinary English word after a "token" or "key" label in a tool result is no longer masked as a secret (a40d199)

## [0.8.20] - 2026-11-04

### Fixes

- names and phone numbers in user directories and chat profiles are masked; a commit hash next to an AWS key is no longer taken for its secret (b974c29)
- a gateway that cannot record the release of a value says so, and the person may simply try again (33400a4)

## [0.8.19] - 2026-11-04

### Fixes

- a JSON response with many findings spreads them faster: each string is searched only for the values whose longest word it holds (fa2b787)
- a hook's first long tool result is scanned a third faster: a keyword rule compiles the head of an alternative only where that alternative matches (b4ee4af)
- measure_resources runs on a Linux host without /usr/bin/time: BENCH_TIME names GNU time (a6c31cf)

## [0.8.18] - 2026-11-04

### Features

- a password or name in a Slack bold or code element, or in an Atlassian code node, is masked like the sentence around it (e13c6cb)

### Fixes

- a rule with context words is checked faster: a word the window does not hold as a substring is not searched for as a whole word (1a22387)
- a response with many distinct keys keeps the label of each key cached (65,536 keys instead of 4,096) (2822cb4)
- a Slack response is scanned up to 40 % faster: a string its record already holds after the same label is scanned once (7a1e0a0)
- a JSON response picks its rules faster: a keyword with a three-letter piece the response lacks is not searched for (b59321b)
- a JSON response is cut into its strings faster: a string without an escape is not walked by character, and a key's label is worked out once (f7ffe63)
- a JSON response with repeated keys is scanned faster: each key's column name is folded once (c4a74fd)
- in a JSON response, a company word or a template in another field no longer hides a street after its label (35f86eb)
- a JSON response is scanned faster: each record walks only the rules that can fire somewhere in the response (98ebc36)

## [0.8.17] - 2026-11-04

### Fixes

- an empty field no longer splits a JSON record into one scan per field (cca7a8c)
- each field of a JSON record decodes its base64 and hex with its own budget (727f10a)
- a field of a JSON record no longer hides a secret or an address in another field (dc21a78). Known limit of this
  release: a street after its label (address: …) is still hidden by a company or place word in another field, and
  the template check after an EU street still reads the next field; fixed in 0.8.18 (35f86eb)
- an address after an empty field of a JSON record keeps its field (f53a300)
- a JSON response is scanned 17-23 % faster: a rule with no other gate runs only where its literal can be (0865a7f)
- a hook starts faster: the personal-data regexes compile on first use (f78ec13)
- a hook starts faster: the rules' leading literals are read from a file instead of parsing 920 patterns (b54f895)
- a tool result with thousands of addresses is masked instead of withheld (44fbb12)

## [0.8.16] - 2026-11-03

### Features

## [0.8.15] - 2026-11-03

### Features

- the library tells a caller that applies the name spans itself which span is a product name (remote.is_product_name) (d8c7be0)

### Fixes

- the name service no longer masks a product name such as Claude Code, GitHub Actions or Docker Desktop as a person (5777f90)
- a release that changes no detection still gets its results directory, so its tag can be verified (162f067)

## [0.8.14] - 2026-11-03

### Features

- a command or a file gets the value of a Sensitive Reference from your gateway, and the AI never sees it (1fb2a49)

## [0.8.13] - 2026-11-03

### Features

- a phone number after Tel. or Telefon is masked in a typed prompt too (fbf8544)
- the AI knows why an example value such as 040 3456789 stays unmasked (80da048)

### Fixes

- a benchmark report names the release it measured, not the old manifest number (f44b034)

### Security

- the display part of a server token can no longer turn a refused command into an allowed one (02e57cd)
- a value glued to a placeholder key in a tool result is masked (b4721f1)

## [0.8.12] - 2026-11-02

### Features

- a person's name under author, reviewer or assignee in API data is found when its surname is a word (5c0429e)

### Fixes

- User is a surname after a role key too (04cb5d4)
- an account or a team after a prefixed role key stays text, and Guest stays a surname (7cee7cf)
- a rule whose leading characters are not in the text is skipped before its regex runs (92380fd)
- a greeting alone (Hallo, Hi, Dear) is no longer masked as a person by the name service (0403692)

## [0.8.11] - 2026-11-02

### Fixes

- a string without a label starts a scan of its own in the lines layout (bad67e1)
- a key that could change the label line is no label, and findings are placed in one pass (25c5424)
- findings_by_leaf scans one record at a time, each string after its key, as written (59c57e4)

## [0.8.10] - 2026-11-02

### Features

- a parsed response is scanned once, and each finding comes back in its string (09202fa)

### Fixes

- fields= scans a value bare only when its label gives a hit (1ec5f4d)
- German greetings and street words are no names, with ß or with ss (c046907)
- German names with ß are found after their label and before a mail address (66550e2)
- findings_by_leaf writes str subclasses and any depth as json.dumps does (b882297)

## [0.8.9] - 2026-11-02

### Features

- run.sh ner start runs the local name service with a secret of its own, and maisecrets checks it before each text (3ad743c)

### Fixes

- the proof and the text of the name service check go to one address (302bfbc)
- review findings on the name service check: no text after a timeout, closed when the kept secret is lost, a real proof in /maisecrets:ner (1fc19c4)
- run.sh ner start runs the first image that proves its secret, and /maisecrets:ner names an older one (75386e2)
- review findings on the challenge: the proof is read to the deadline, the schema names unauthorized and not_ours (bb0ae1b)
- a product or model name alone (Claude, Copilot, GitHub, Jenkins …) is no longer masked as a person (014e51a)

## [0.8.8] - 2026-11-01

### Features

- a prompt waits up to 1 s for the name service and says once, with the reason, when its names were not checked (552b6a0)
- the client sends the bearer of a name service that wants one (2fd8b1a)
- finds a German phone number after Durchwahl, Festnetz and Rufnr (fe4282d)

- an explicit fallback service for tool results while the local one is not running (e7d97d0)
- after a restart, the session start brings the local name service back (0655b1d)
- with names from the local service on, names in your prompts become placeholders in Claude Code (f244cc3)

- review findings: no prompt over the network, no fallback on a network error (446f86f)

## [0.8.6] - 2026-10-31

- use the config file that Claude Code itself reads (6cf98da)

## [0.6.31] - 2026-10-16

- a password after its word and a space is redacted, without the stop of the sentence (5096239)

## [0.6.30] - 2026-10-16

### Fixes

- on Windows the route for a document puts the value into a text file that the script reads (fa362f1)
- on Windows a refusal names the route that puts a value into a document (5dc8af7)

## [0.6.29] - 2026-10-16

### Features

- write the key header only for a server that sent a token and supports it (48ca94b)
- get a value back from the MCP server that masked it (42afa85)

### Fixes

- a token that the model sent before the server was in use is no sighting and no trigger (28fdfff)
- the header goes on the entry that sent the token, by name and URL (6ab449d)
- close the gaps that the fourth review found (538d4c6)
- close the gaps that the third review found (4e32659)
- a token seen again after 24 hours resolves again (d0f52cb)

- close the gaps that the first review found (e7a66f5)

## [0.6.28] - 2026-10-16

### Fixes

- the document route of a deno refusal says deno run (fdb82d7)
- a refusal names the document route only where the rehydration setting lets it through (f3b9814)
- the skill tells the model how a placeholder goes into a document or a file (86c5ae4)
- when inline code cannot take a value, the refusal names the route to a document (dbabb47)

## [0.6.27] - 2026-10-16

### Features

- mask the names, case numbers and customer names on your own term list (1699c9d)

### Fixes

- review round 2 of the rebase: a listed value stored before stays a term, team lists are read with a bound (2f42ac3)
- review round 1 of the rebase: a union with a term stays a term, template braces mark no name (50a8b47)
- a wipe that cannot take the terms lock says what is left and how to finish (b21a092)
- a damaged marked-name record stops the hooks, and a wipe removes a proposal written at the same time (3c9bc9a)
- terms suggest never prints a name; it writes a private proposal file (41b9078)
- a team list cannot slow every hook with one stem repeated many times (ee0655b)
- a listed email address or token-shaped case number stays a term and is never resolved (a8ccc9b)
- term changes at the same time all hold; a damaged marked-name file stops the hooks; expired marks leave the disk (dd908a0)
- the refusal of an add without a source names the rule it broke in plain words (06229fa)
- term add masks the surname as a whole word, never as a stem; Codex adds follow your own rules (ebdd1e9)
- a token that holds a value you resolved is taken out whole again (88ad84c)
- the session start parses the term lists once (25bea54)
- an add from a prompt without a source gets the floor of a team list (ead02e6)
- a private-use character in a file the AI writes stays as it is (e5705e0)
- term add also masks the surname alone and joined names; typos and other origins change nothing (f1756ab)
- build the term index at session start and after a typed change, not inside a tool hook (27a1547)
- mask spaced *…* terms, overlapping names, NFD text, joined names and team lists safely (2a82c69)
- a listed name inside a stored password no longer leaves the rest of the password in clear (3f7c361)

## [0.6.26] - 2026-10-16

### Fixes

- a company's postcode and VAT ID stay text with its street (4cd8b0d)

## [0.6.24] - 2026-10-16

### Features

- masks a card number written in groups in a tool result without a card word nearby, and knows more card words (cea3b1f)
- before reading a password export, a .har, a .vcf or an .ics file, the skill offers a masked copy and reads only that (94eb12e)
- judges a generic API key in a tool result by the entropy floor of its alphabet, which finds 8 more CredData credentials (d663062)
- finds personal data and secrets in 18 more fixed forms in tool results, such as an ID after "member", an address after "Address:", a FHIR identifier and a GitHub Actions ::add-mask:: value (44e2169)

### Fixes

- a busy machine no longer lets an encoded key through in a tool result (0f6c60f)
- after a password label, the name of a constant, a time such as 0:default, the word after "passed:" and a table cell of prose are no longer masked (07312aa)
- finds the counterparty IBAN in an MT940 bank statement export, right after its subfield code ?31 (c1215d3)
- a UK postcode alone is no longer masked, and a US NPI, a Swedish organisation number and a UK number plate need their check digit (1e6e78b)
- finds an e-mail address or a phone number written right next to Chinese, Japanese or Korean text (0889bbf)

## [0.6.23] - 2026-10-15

### Features

- decide what happens when the AI reads a PDF or an image, and send a PDF as masked text only (d599b5d)

### Fixes

- no hit in a converted PDF counts as a test fixture, also by its content, and a dangling rpath link counts twice (f13f774)
- a converted PDF under a tests folder keeps its labelled passwords masked (5a979a7)
- a missing rpath folder counts by the folder above it, and a converted PDF of one endless line says so (31c32aa)
- an inherited ACL entry on macOS and an rpath folder searched first also stop read_pdf convert (4569e77)
- read_pdf convert stops a PDF that eats memory, refuses a scan with page numbers, and runs a Homebrew pdftotext on a Mac with two admins (1d20371)

## [0.6.22] - 2026-10-15

### Features

- the session start counts your rules of your own and names a rule folder that is missing (d8c6993)
- add detection rules of your own from folders, and an allow list for single values (0f782bb)

### Fixes

- a rule of your own runs after the cleaned copy of a tool result, and the allow list holds for the personal-data rules (e0481e2)
- a rule of your own runs after the personal-data rules of 0.6.21 too, so it never cuts a name or an address (42f6cfd)
- a correct rule with several keywords is no longer timed out, and `rules check` makes a folder run at the next call (20c4a18)
- the folder limits also hold for refused, duplicate and oversized rules, and a slow branch is timed (0d3f4b0)
- a rule folder can no longer take out another folder's rule, run an untested rule, or stall a hook with many files (79a9dd4)
- a slow rule of your own is found by its own regex time, also over many strings (de45baa)
- a large output can no longer take a correct rule of your own out (4cc626a)
- rule folders keep slow, broken and linked rules out, and never print a refused line (923d3b2)
- a rule of your own no longer cuts an e-mail address, IBAN or phone number short (3772d16)
- a rule of your own that holds a hook until the watchdog answers is left out from the next call on (150e699)

- a date after a birth label (DOB, Geburtsdatum, né le, fecha de nacimiento) is masked in a tool result (3c56393)

### Fixes

### Security

- a prompt from a client that a program started changes no setting (0e50f95)

## [0.6.20] - 2026-10-15

### Features

- OpenAI and Anthropic keys of newer lengths (OpenAI: 8 to 400 characters around `T3BlbkFJ`; Anthropic: 60 to 140 before `AA`), GitLab trigger and CI job tokens in their newer forms are found without a label (18f35f1)
- 23 more token formats are found without a label (Google OAuth client secret, SonarQube, Dynatrace, NuGet, crates.io, Dropbox, GitHub App JWT, …) (7194cc0)
- a PEM private key in base64 is found and masked whole (Kubernetes Secret tls.key, ssh-privatekey) (c47bb41)

### Fixes

- a certificate bundle with a legacy encrypted private key in base64 is found (50742db)
- a base64 PEM key needs a key body, ends at its END line, and GitLab job tokens are taken whole (436069a)
- a routable GitLab token with a long routing payload is masked whole, not only its first part (98b4f30)
- Resend, Ionic, Airtable and WakaTime tokens are found without the provider's name beside them (768989d)

## [0.6.19] - 2026-10-15

### Features

- 25 more token formats are found without a label (Google OAuth, Claude Code OAuth, Tailscale, Discord, Telegram, …) (2787122)
- a crypto wallet seed phrase, private key or extended private key is a secret (9f54dea)
- Swiss and Austrian numbers with regions ch and at (AHV number, UID, social insurance number) (77fcc27)

- an IBAN written with hyphens or in lower case is found (28993c1)
- a card number next to "Karte", "carte", "carta" or "tarjeta" is found, not only next to "card" (8f256a8)

### Fixes

- a German VAT ID without a VAT word and a company register number are no longer masked (c6184b4)

### Other

## [0.6.17] - 2026-10-14

### Fixes

- the word for "password" in another language stays text as a locale value in a tool result (af47b7e)
- the secret-hygiene scan reads files, commits and tool results as the tool hook does (0dbca9b)
- a word after a label in a tool result or a file no longer blocks later prompts; later tool results still mask it (945de68)
- a password of letters after a password label is redacted in tool results and files; a typed prompt keeps the rule of 0.6.16 (e0ee60c)

### Other

- Merge branch 'fix/tool-results-take-more-passwords' into 'main' (575827a)

## [0.6.16] - 2026-10-14

### Fixes

- the STS session token in X-Amz-Security-Token is redacted, also in a presigned URL (f3670a7)
- a password label before a long run of letters scans in linear time, 320 KB in 0.7 s instead of 10 s (721306e)
- a TOTP or HOTP seed after an otp, mfa or 2fa label is redacted (a46e38e)
- a key after a secret label is redacted in XML elements, calls and short values, also after hmac, session, cookie and psk (3da6b7a)
- the NTLM authenticate message, NATS nkey seeds, PASERK secret keys and PASETO tokens are redacted (9f2045d)
- a password after a password label is redacted when it looks random, also in XML, SQL and PowerShell; words, paths, references and measures stay text (74b851d)
- an Elasticsearch API key in an Authorization: ApiKey header is redacted (140c52c)
- each key in a list after a secret label is redacted, such as "api_keys": ["…", "…"] (ea4d655)

### Other

- Merge branch 'fix/more-labelled-keys-and-url-credentials' into 'main' (fe741d3)

## [0.6.15] - 2026-10-13

### Fixes

- one unusual betterleaks filter string can no longer switch off the whole ruleset (5237ca8)
- no helper tool can hold the session open, and an image output is checked to its last byte (8917315)
- a second curl -u or --user in the same command is redacted too (b6cee56)
- a tool result with stored values is redacted faster (d52521e)
- reading an image or a PDF is fast, and the shape check no longer damages the file (28b8137)
- on macOS and Linux a slow check now blocks the output instead of letting it through (f2c7b8e)
- a long line of AWS key ids or curl commands no longer stalls the check (1fa4fbc)
- finds passwords and tokens in a JSON object inside a string, such as {\"password\":\"…\"} (d159fb7)
- finds more passwords in commands and text: --password, mysql -p, Redis AUTH, .netrc and "my password is …" (32a729c)

### Other

- Merge branch 'fix/only-the-gitleaks-rules-betterleaks-lacks-stay' into 'main' (b3c7473)

## [0.6.12] - 2026-10-12

### Fixes

- the review of the #16 change: pipes, paths after a run verb, values after an option (ae39418)
- the consent check reads the low findings left from #15 (bea15d5)
- a test value hides only its own type, and %40 needs an address context (fb771c3)
- a test value counts only for its own type, and %40 only where an address is expected (b16d6e6)
- documented test values, percent-encoded emails and invalid SSNs (6432d2c)

### Other

## [0.6.11] - 2026-10-10

### Features

- consent-report shows what the ssh consent check would ask on your own sessions (2ea0184)

### Fixes

- the consent check reads a package manager's exec, long xargs options and a find -exec clause (f757dc6)
- the consent check reads a here-string into a shell, a trap's code and env -S (c018436)
- the consent check reads a session name, a -- and a URL option where they stand, and fish code glued to its option (c5f7d22)
- the consent check finds a container's program by its place and a program path by its directory (8d6dc0e)
- the consent check reads a shell's arguments, a container's inner command and a launcher's program (a16f23f)
- the consent check reads a container command, a continued argument list and AppleScript the way the shell does (60f58c3)
- the consent check sees ssh as a path, after an escape and in fish or AppleScript code, and no longer after a substitution in an argument (291ce37)
- consent-report names no host in a reason, and the check reads a few more launchers and lookups (034c520)
- the consent check reads launchers past their flags and stops asking for a daemon, a package or a file named like ssh (d822281)
- the consent check asks for a launcher or a subcommand it does not know, and no longer for git's option words in a message (7da266c)
- the ssh consent check asks where a command starts ssh, not where a command mentions it (9a04d72)

### Other

- Merge branch 'fix/c21-asks-on-visible-executable-intent' into 'main' (b06ab19)

## [0.6.10] - 2026-10-09

### Breaking

- no report form opens a browser or runs gh; the person files the issue in GitHub's form (4c91c53)

### Features

- every failure site records its code, and the launchers and the guard leave markers (4703c64)
- /maisecrets:report incident shows the report to the person, also with a damaged store (327ef52)
- hooks record their failures after the answer, and the hook always ends in time (5a53a88)
- a local incident record with closed values, markers that follow nothing, and a report that sends nothing (3f908c0)

### Fixes

- without Python, run.cmd refuses every hook event in JSON with exit 0, so Codex no longer runs the tool (7e98099)
- clear returns the plugin marker it removed also when the home cannot be listed (dd5e7b7)
- run.cmd leaves its marker in its own hooks folder, with no child and no touch of the home (dc8d7b5)
- run.cmd makes its marker in a detached child, so a stalled home cannot hold the hook (38fb21c)
- code review round 1 - a winning watchdog writes no heartbeat before its exit, and markers never hold a hook (4f07b23)
- one layer against a symlinked record, so its test can fail (c5617e8)

### Security

- a home the hook cannot search no longer lets a prompt through on Python 3.9 (e45ab0a)

### Other

- Merge branch 'feat/local-diagnostics-build' into 'main' (5c79d73)

## [0.6.9] - 2026-10-08

### Features

- the caps on stored values are 200 per session and 1000 uses an hour, and you can raise them (493cf77)

### Fixes

- the mod's tries share one budget on the mods clock, and a test holds it; README and PRIVACY name every connection (26a2482)
- the mod tries the next Python after an error exit too, within one 8 s budget; review round 1 of 0.6.9 (07fafe6)
- the mod starts the plugin's Python with fixed arguments, without a shell or an environment read (0eec13d)

### Other

- Merge branch 'feat/limits-from-the-logs' into 'main' (8485966)

## [0.6.8] - 2026-10-08

### Fixes

- a URL password that looks like a date counts as a date only if the calendar has it (3a46fc3)
- the SigV4 scope ends at a separator; a URL password filter takes only a whole reference or a real date (567a1d5)
- only a whole encoded reference or date in a URL password is text; the SigV4 scope must end at aws4_request (14b3402)
- the end of a call commits only its own session and agent, however late; a failed call carries its hint (e68c7b7)
- a password with no user in a URL is found (redis://:password@host) (282281e)
- the AWS key id in a presigned URL or a SigV4 header is no secret (ebec40b)
- a destination is seen only after the call ran; a declined call leaves no record (04f268b)

## [0.6.7] - 2026-10-08

### Features

- maisecrets notes where each stored secret was sent, and /maisecrets:list shows it (dd74bc9)

### Fixes

- a file label uses / on Windows, and only the home folder itself becomes ~ (cc1ee66)
- a heredoc after a parenthesis, any carriage return, and $ in double quotes ask (review round 7) (adb691e)
- an ssh word in a comment the shell may not read as one asks; the parser stays as in 0.6.6 (review round 6) (0de44da)
- a # or << inside (( )), $[ ], [[ ]] or ${ } is no comment and no heredoc (review round 5) (d6c3339)
- read -v from the dequoted words (review round 5) (aa05dc4)
- escaped space before # and printf -v ask; a record goes when its value expires (review round 4) (3120795)
- text exemption only for a line that runs nothing else (review round 3) (b335e82)
- ssh text rule only for quoted text, destination record bounded (review round 2) (204d745)
- review round 1 of 0.6.7 (codex): text that a later part runs stays an ssh call; observing never waits (9e7d60f)
- the word ssh in text (an issue body, a grep pattern) no longer asks (25778ab)
- /maisecrets:settings ssh_autonomous_hosts add HOST shows the card instead of an error (dff5443)

### Other

- a value in the output of a failed call is stored, cleaned from the transcript and named to the AI (16ae737)
- the settings read as cards with the next command, a change shows its result, and hints can be reset (fcf41dc)

### Fixes

- a group name in the autonomous hosts stands for its members only; the failed-output message says when cleaning failed (dafba9b)
- the failed-output message says what was stored and whether the transcript is cleaned (7a70dfe)
- a command that calls a consent writer by name is refused, and a wrong Codex sentence ends the code (18c1ef4)
- with ssh_consent on, a yes allows only the asked command; a host window opens only from your own prompt (8be6a89)

### Other

## [0.6.5] - 2026-10-07

### Features

### Fixes

- only a prompt the person typed changes a setting, and the hint comes once under parallel hooks (3694cf8)

### Other

## [0.6.4] - 2026-10-07

### Features

### Fixes

- the guard reads the switch of the copies that are installed, by their exact ids (codex review) (97b6950)
- a second maisecrets copy switched off no longer silences the guard (1121958)
- command names in any case, a size cap that answers in time (opus review, round 3) (7ba4ed8)
- ~/.ssh is guarded by a list of reads, not of writers (codex review, round 3) (f6daea9)
- the deny list and the ~/.ssh rule read the whole command (opus review of the repair) (6368ed8)
- redirects are read from the raw text, mosh and rsync ports keep the host key (codex review of the repair) (2a3cbad)
- consent keys follow ssh's first value, and the hidden targets ask (opus review) (ff33819)
- consent keys carry user and port, forwards and content reads are writes (codex review) (9522730)

## [0.5.16] - 2026-09-30

- **The Claude plugin directory accepts the hooks again.** It refused 0.5.15 because the PowerShell
  part of each hook started `hooks/run.cmd` from a variable; the directory wants every program named
  by its path. The hooks now name `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run.cmd` directly. Nothing changes in
  what they do.

### Fixes

- the Claude plugin directory accepts the hooks again (70e73df)

### Other

- Merge branch 'fix/directory-spell-the-program' into 'main' (8d1a65e)

## [0.5.15] - 2026-09-30

- **Codex on Windows: a removed plugin folder now blocks instead of letting the tool run.** Codex
  removes the folder of the old version when it installs a new one, also under an open session
  (codex-cli 0.159.0, measured). The Windows command of each hook (`commandWindows`, run by
  `cmd.exe`) now checks for the launcher first and answers with a block when it is gone, as the
  macOS and Linux command already did. The text tells Codex users to exit and run `codex resume`
  instead of a Claude Code command.

- **Code after a colon is no longer stored as a secret.** A line such as `if not token: <statement>`
  put the statement word into the vault, and maisecrets then redacted that word in every later text,
  in source code too. A statement keyword after a label (`break`, `return`, `pass`, `raise`, …) is not
  a value now; so a password that is exactly such a word is not stored either. One lowercase word after a label, with
  the sentence going on, is still stored: without a dictionary it looks like a password of letters,
  and a missed password costs more than a false positive.

- **The false positives of the old detector stop at the next session start.** A statement word
  such as `return` that an earlier version stored after a label stayed in the vault until it
  expired, and maisecrets redacted it in every text until then. The session start now marks these
  entries so that maisecrets no longer redacts the word in other texts, and names their keys once.
  Nothing is deleted: the placeholder still works, and `/maisecrets:forget` deletes the entry. The
  start finds them by fingerprint and reads no stored value. The same word stored by
  `/maisecrets:put` or another rule stays as it is.

- **A subagent's report no longer stops the session.** When a subagent quoted a value in the shape of
  a secret, its report reached the session as a prompt, and maisecrets blocked it until you pressed
  Cmd+V or `/ms`. A model of this session wrote that text, so the block protected nothing. The report
  now passes when it proves itself against the files of this session: the call that started the
  subagent, the subagent's own transcript, and its last answer. A value that anyone added outside the
  answer still blocks. `"pass_agent_reports": false` in `~/.maisecrets/config.json` turns this off.

- **Fewer false alarms in source code.** A run over the Python standard library (36.6 MB, no real
  secret in it) found 38 "secrets", 666 "IP addresses of a person" and 26 "phone numbers". These are
  no longer hits: a name on the right side of an assignment (`authkey=authkey`, `self.token = nextchar`,
  `TOKEN_ENDS = TSPECIALS | WSP`), a word of an error message (`pwd: expected bytes`), a format string,
  a time zone (`key = "Europe/Dublin"`), a mask (`*******`), a signed number in code (`a = +4294967296`),
  a number with more than 15 digits, and the documentation, shared, reserved and multicast address
  ranges and the public DNS resolvers. A quoted value, a value in a properties file and a phone
  number in prose are still found.

- **Test passwords no longer stop the work.** A password that maisecrets finds only by its label
  (`password = '…'`) is a fixture in test code: in a file on a test path, in a grep line of a test
  file, or after a test marker such as `def test_`, `assert` or `describe(`. A pasted unit test now
  passes, and a Read of a test file keeps its fixtures. A token shape (`glpat-`, `AKIA`, a JWT, a
  private key) and personal data are still found in test code, also after a label such as
  `token = "…"`. An `.env` file and a recorded HTTP cassette are no test code, even under `tests/`,
  and `assert` alone does not make production code a test.

- **Fewer false alarms in config, docs and code.** A review of 679 snippets of normal work and a run
  over a real repository found more values that are no secret, and these are no hits now:
  - fixtures that name themselves (`testpass`, `secret123`, `Passw0rd!`) and a default that equals
    its label or user (`POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres`, `curl -u admin:admin`). A real password that
    holds such a word and a word of its own (`Contest-Winter2026!`, `Passion2026!`) is still found
  - the next label of an `.env.example` (`DB_PASSWORD=` followed by `API_KEY=`)
  - types (`Option<String>`, `list[str]`), templates (`mcp_{user}`, `?token={id}`), version pins
    (`tokenizers==0.20.3`), durations (`TTL_REFRESH_TOKEN = 15552000`), UUIDs, elided values
    (`sk-...`) and labels of a derived thing (`secret_name`, `password_hash`)
  - e-mail addresses at `example.com`, `.test`, `.invalid` and `.localhost`, and a system mailbox at
    `.local` or `.internal` (a person's name there, such as `hans.mueller@firma.local`, is still
    found), and section numbers such as `RFC 6749 4.1.2.1`
  - YAML anchors, shell expansions such as `${REDIS_PASSWORD:?…}`, a type made of the words of its
    label (`token_data: TokenData`) and a command with a path
  In the tests of that repository, the label-rule hits that a Read acted on went from 379 to none.
  The example on the first start is now an address that maisecrets stops.

- **A word no longer follows you around for a day.** When maisecrets found a word such as
  `postgres` only by its label (`DB_PASSWORD=postgres`), it stored it and then redacted the word in
  every later text of every session: `docker ps` showed a placeholder for the image, and the prompt
  "add a postgres service" was blocked. Such a word is now replaced where it was found and nowhere
  else; its placeholder still works. This holds for the default words of services and of code
  (`postgres`, `admin`, `redis`, `changeme`, `plaintext` …); any other value, also a random
  lower-case one, is still found everywhere.
  Words that an older version stored are marked at the next session start.

- **A busy computer no longer ends a session.** When maisecrets answered a call too late, the guard
  said to exit the session and resume it, and an agent that worked on its own stopped there for a
  person. The next call would have worked. The guard now says to run the call again, and names the
  restart only as the second step; when maisecrets started and was only slow, it names no restart.
  After a plugin update, which the guard sees in the trash, it asks for the restart as before.

### Features

- a reported false alarm links the test data that maisecrets leaves alone (f3f2ead)

### Fixes

- a subagent's report passes on Windows too (fbb2d34)
- a password that starts with & or ! is no YAML anchor, and many hits stay linear (c674527)
- the scan is linear in a long line, and the review of 3e5d53e is closed (b4a7c54)
- a long line is scanned in time again, and the final review's findings are closed (3e5d53e)
- tel inside a word is no telephone label (0147e81)
- the second Codex review of 05052fe found eight more; each is closed (37a68a8)
- the Codex review of 31fdfd1 found seven more ways through; each is closed (05052fe)
- no relaxation of this release lets a real, detectable value through (31fdfd1)
- a busy computer no longer ends a session (50468d0)
- a real subagent report is no longer blocked by its own shape (ba63f17)
- a word no longer follows you around for a day (6a9162f)
- fewer false alarms in config, docs and code (c33271b)
- test passwords no longer stop the work (edd6df0)
- fewer false alarms in source code (86d56e8)
- a subagent's report no longer stops the session (fbbe7c5)
- the session start deletes the code words an older detector stored (5757d20)
- the review of the detector and the Windows fallback (d805b1e)
- Codex on Windows blocks when the plugin folder is gone (28c64d0)
- code after a colon is not a secret value (aa79eab)

### Other

- Merge branch 'feat/agent-reports' into 'main' (aa639a4)

## [0.5.14] - 2026-09-29

- **The restart command stands on a line of its own** in the refusal of the guard, so it is easy to
  see, and a triple click copies just that line. The refusal now says the command *was* copied to
  your clipboard: a terminal with copy-on-select (the default in Ghostty) replaces the clipboard as
  soon as you select text, also text in the refusal itself.

### Fixes

- the restart command stands on its own line; the refusal says it was copied (3fef4b4)

### Other

- Merge branch 'fix/guard-message-layout' into 'main' (0d17b8b)

## [0.5.13] - 2026-09-29

- **Synced installs: the guard now gives the restart command.** After a synced update,
  `/reload-plugins` can keep the path of the gone plugin folder (anthropics/claude-code#97847), and
  then it cannot load maisecrets again. The refusal of the guard now says so and names the command
  that works: exit, then `claude --resume <id of this session>` in the directory where the session
  started. Run `/maisecrets:guard install` once more if you installed the guard yourself.
- **The guard puts that command on your clipboard**, once per session (`pbcopy` on macOS, `clip` on
  Windows, `wl-copy`, `xclip` or `xsel` on Linux). Exit, paste, press Enter. The refusal says so only
  when the copy worked. `MAISECRETS_GUARD_CLIPBOARD=off` turns it off.

### Features

- the resume command goes to the clipboard, once per session (857be68)

### Fixes

- the refusal gives the restart command when /reload-plugins cannot help (7f1292e)

### Other

- Merge branch 'fix/guard-restart-hint' into 'main' (8f58a86)

## [0.5.12] - 2026-09-29

- **Windows without Git Bash: maisecrets now protects Claude Code there.** Claude Code runs a hook
  command in PowerShell when Git for Windows is not installed. The hook commands of 0.5.11 were bash
  only: PowerShell refused to parse them, the hook failed without a block, and a prompt with a secret
  reached the model. Each hook command now works in bash and in PowerShell. The `PowerShell` tool of
  Claude Code meets the store guard, and a placeholder in a PowerShell command is refused with the
  reason.
- **A guard you installed yourself** (`/maisecrets:guard install`, not a synced install) keeps the tool
  list of its version. Run `/maisecrets:guard install` once more after this update, so that it also
  covers the `PowerShell` tool.
- **Codex users: re-trust the hooks once in `/hooks` after this update.** `hooks/hooks.json` changed.
  Until the hooks are trusted again, Codex runs no maisecrets hook and says nothing.

### Fixes

- refusals name what works without Git Bash; the PowerShell part has a test (2920339)
- the store guard knows the Credential Locker listing, the launchers' get and two Windows spellings (a2023ac)
- maisecrets protects Claude Code on Windows without Git Bash (8ad4795)
- every generation of the synced folder counts; the guard's own refusal names it (f979433)

### Other

- Merge branch 'feat/windows-powershell' into 'main' (83ba31b)

## [0.5.11] - 2026-09-29

- **Synced installs: a guard against the update gap, set up by maisecrets itself.** An update of a
  plugin that the organisation syncs from claude.ai can leave a session without maisecrets, silently.
  At its next session start a synced maisecrets places `~/.claude/maisecrets-guard.py` and registers
  it once in `~/.claude/settings.json` (a backup first, only the hooks change, one line says so). The
  guard blocks a prompt or tool call that maisecrets did not answer and names `/reload-plugins`.
  `/maisecrets:guard remove` takes it away; `"guard": false` in the config or the machine policy
  keeps it off. Installs from the marketplace and Codex are not touched.
- **Codex:** a placeholder in a file edit (`apply_patch`) is now resolved, and a patch against the
  maisecrets store is refused.

### Features

- a guard outside the plugin folder stops a session in which an update left maisecrets not running (4cdbdcd)

### Fixes

- "guard": false works without a guard.json; a person's --off stays their own (72eef2d)
- a multi-line value stays file content in a Codex patch; the guard waits for the answer (8d28b90)
- the update window reads the change time; the measured folder counts per account (8e7b4cc)
- no lasting block after an organisation removes maisecrets; the script is guarded too (c02e964)
- a patch header behind any whitespace is a header; the guard expects by account (3a158d4)
- two registrations pass a healthy call; an indented Codex patch header is a header (5af2899)
- Codex apply_patch resolves a placeholder and never writes the maisecrets store (5f3a399)

### Other

- Merge branch 'fix/guard-windows-tests' into 'main' (3c998cd)
- Merge branch 'feat/codex-apply-patch' into 'main' (746374c)

## [0.5.10] - 2026-09-29

- **Behaviour change: maisecrets adds no approval of its own by default.** A value still never
  reaches the model, and a form where it could turn into code is still refused. What changed: an
  MCP call and an ssh command that get a real value no longer ask first, and on Codex a value in a
  published-text field (`text`, `message`, `body` …) now goes in. In Claude Code your permission
  rules decide, as for any other call; in Codex maisecrets answers `allow`, as it did for Bash and
  for other MCP fields, and Codex's sandbox and MCP tool approval still apply. To keep the ask of
  0.5.9 for MCP and ssh, set `"rehydration": "confirm"` in `~/.maisecrets/config.json` or in the
  machine policy. `confirm` is stricter than 0.5.9 on the other paths: Bash and Write/Edit ask too,
  and Codex refuses every rehydration, because it cannot ask. `"block"` turns rehydration off.
- **For administrators:** a machine policy file that exists but cannot be read now makes the hooks
  fail closed (before, it counted as no policy). Keep it and its folder readable by every user. A
  key in it that looks like a misspelled `rehydration`, `resolve_in_files` or `ssh_via_sandbox`
  blocks rehydration until it is fixed; other unknown keys are ignored with a warning.

### Features

- maisecrets adds no approval of its own by default; rehydration confirm and block are optional (9eead0c)

### Fixes

- the limiter answers an empty key list without an index error (82264ef)
- a lowered key cap no longer breaks a call with known keys (9725364)
- a misspelled safety key blocks even next to a valid setting; caps count per call (650167c)
- a setting that cannot be read as written blocks rehydration; no partial resolve (cdb57a8)
- an ignored config file never loosens the rehydration policy (a043a33)

### Other

- Merge branch 'feat/rehydration-policy' into 'main' (b945f23)

## [0.5.9] - 2026-09-28

- **Codex:** `hooks/hooks.json` changed in this release, so Codex asks once in `/hooks` to trust
  the hooks again.

### Features

- sudo -n before a read-only remote command counts as read-only (a1711d2)
- Norwegian and Czech credential labels, regions no and cz (85a8649)
- Portuguese and Danish credential labels, regions pt, br and dk (161762c)
- French and Dutch credential labels, regions fr, lu, be and nl (b7da1cf)
- Korean and Thai credential labels (6cff625)
- Polish and Turkish credential labels (46d578e)
- Finnish and Swedish credential labels (02c2f1b)
- Spanish and Italian credential labels (1b2ca9c)

### Fixes

- the context window is cut from the original text, then lowered (1d2918c)
- Turkish labels in capitals, such as ŞİFRE: (ce1aef5)
- a refusal about the store says what the user does next (1aad280)
- a second hop names one ssh per host; the sandbox e2e runs an ops user's forms (e64bec6)
- a false-positive report names the forget command and deletes nothing itself (6a1ea89)
- a refusal names the form that works, and the primer says what to do (e5f806a)
- /ms sends the blocked prompt of its own session, also when two sessions wait (f90cc47)
- a hook command that finds no launcher refuses; Claude Code still skips a moved plugin (f6b2cb8)
- a space before the colon of a label, as French typography writes it (a8fad39)

### Security

- every fail-closed answer has the shape of the client that asked (481810d)
- a hook that cannot work refuses in JSON, which Codex reads too (12b8400)
- a session id is a name, never a path, and a command cannot set it (e1bae80)
- an entry point that cannot import the plugin's code refuses instead of passing (1793d1c)
- an MCP resource read that names the store is refused (fd2e23a)

### Other

- Grep without a path, Windows digit scrub, Unicode word boundary (4aa1eb6)
- the Codex review of the read gate, short values and the digit scrub (e07b32f)

- the keyword window ends one line too early (860ba9e)
- two distinct characters after a label are a value (178ebb1)
- an unquoted value after a label ends at the first whitespace (17603ad)
- a dotted reference after a credential label is not a value (51dde31)
- a store call that times out raises RuntimeError without the argv (d8f28f0)
- a stored value that comes back URL-encoded or JSON-escaped is replaced (c36fdef)
- a damaged vault index withholds the tool output instead of passing it raw (3e8e971)
- a payload that is JSON but no object is blocked instead of let through (c23f154)
- release the lock when the index read inside a mutation raises (de86fb5)

## [0.4.2] - 2026-09-27

- **The block notice is three lines:** what kind of thing was found, the one next step (⌘V or
  Ctrl+V, or /ms), and where to report a wrong detection. What is stored and for how long is in
  `/maisecrets:list`.

### Features

- a three-line block notice - the kind found, the one next step, the report (efa93cd)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-27

### Fixes

- an expired entry no longer breaks status, list and a new paste of the same value (f8172bf)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-27

- **Changed for everyone:** the block notice is new (plain words, what was found, the prompt with the
  short forms, where the values stay and for how long), and the first session start only offers
  `/ms` (`/maisecrets:shortcut`) instead of installing it. An existing `/ms` keeps working.

- **The block notice speaks plainly** and shows what was found (masked), the prompt with the short
  forms, where the values stay and for how long.
- **`/maisecrets:list`** shows what is stored, masked; **`/maisecrets:forget <key>`** deletes one entry.
- **You see every redaction**: one line names the values replaced in a tool result.
- **The session start is shorter** and names no file paths; `/ms` is offered once instead of being
  installed, and Codex gets tips that work there.
- **The `secret-hygiene` skill** finds leaked secrets in a repository and its history (date, author,
  pushed or not, provider), guides the rotation, and writes redacted copies of files to share.

### Breaking

- the secret-hygiene skill, a plain block notice, /maisecrets:list and /maisecrets:forget (a77f8ad)

### Features

- audit the local Claude Code and Codex transcripts for secrets that already reached the provider (df96aba)
- a plain block notice that shows what was found and what would be sent; /maisecrets:list and /maisecrets:forget; the skill reports date, author, pushed state, provider and every skip (91e5b79)
- secret-hygiene finds leaked secrets by location, guides the rotation, writes redacted copies (fb5ef18)

### Fixes

- the skill tests run in CI and a skipped test is no proof; the release waits for the beliefs replay (2750b3b)
- review findings - a ++ line is content, labels in a sentence, expire keeps its lock, the scrub keeps bytes and mode; feat(skill): the ChatGPT listing and a flat zip (37c330b)
- the scan runs on every core, keyword rules only near their keywords, no size limit; fix(beliefs): each replay run gets a fresh bytecode cache (2b969e2)

### Other

- Merge branch 'main' into feat/secret-hygiene-skill (d22334e)
- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main' into feat/secret-hygiene-skill (de7f2df)

## [0.3.33] - 2026-09-27

- **An MCP call that gets a real value now asks you first** (Claude Code), also in auto and bypass
  mode, with a warning when the value sits in a message body or another published text. Unattended
  runs (`claude -p`) refuse it. On Codex, which cannot ask, a placeholder in such a text field is refused.

### Fixes

- an MCP call gets a real value only after the user confirms; Codex refuses a value in published text (bdb5589)

## [0.3.32] - 2026-09-27

### Fixes

- no .claude-plugin/icon.svg, so the portal reads the icon URL from the manifest; a 30-character subtitle for OpenAI (16e9e0b)

## [0.3.31] - 2026-09-27

### Fixes

- verify_release expects the Codex manifest in the release commit; the test reads that list too (2bdb33f)

## [0.3.30] - 2026-09-27

### Fixes

- a reader retries while another hook process replaces the index or the store (Windows PermissionError) (bfb211c)
- the release job stages the Codex manifest it bumps; a test reads the job's git add line (c67483a)
- the manifest icon is the URL of the PNG on main, which the listing preview renders (bc7f087)

## [0.3.29] - 2026-09-27

### Features

- a Codex manifest with the interface fields and icon; hooks.log names the desktop entry point (da5db56)

## [0.3.28] - 2026-09-27

### Features

- the mcpgate mark as the plugin icon (7594fb5)

### Fixes

- a PNG as the manifest icon (cce176d)
- the icon in every place a listing looks for it (5cbb758)
- block and redaction notices one fact per line, and no slash commands on Codex (953da8b)

## [0.3.27] - 2026-09-27

### Features

- privacy page and the listing URLs in the manifest (bc376f0)

## [0.3.26] - 2026-09-27

### Fixes

- exact allowed-tools per command, a plugin icon, no environment token in the GitHub wait (6bbbaa3)

## [0.3.25] - 2026-09-27

- `/maisecrets:shortcut --remove` takes the personal `/ms` away and keeps it away.

### Fixes

- a revert releases as a patch; tests for the operations paths and the release tools (4273160)

## [0.3.24] - 2026-09-27

### Features

- the first session start installs a personal /ms once, unless one exists or shortcut is off (503cf08)

### Fixes

- the plugin's own command names are never a labelled secret (a6b1f6c)

## [0.3.23] - 2026-09-26

- The first session start installs a personal `/ms` for `/maisecrets:send` (unless one exists
  or `"shortcut": false`); `/maisecrets:shortcut [name]` does it by hand.
- `/maisecrets:put` explains the SSH case (no clipboard: use a label in a prompt).

### Features

- /maisecrets:shortcut installs a personal /ms; the answer to a sent prompt shows the text (53553e7)

### Fixes

- one path separator style in the wrapper under Git Bash (9c31784)
- the wrapper honours HOME under Git Bash on Windows (b39ab76)

## [0.3.22] - 2026-09-26

- **Codex users: re-trust the hooks once in `/hooks` after this update.** `hooks/hooks.json`
  changed (Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit joined the PreToolUse matcher, and every hook
  has a `commandWindows` entry). Until the hooks are trusted again, Codex runs no maisecrets
  hook and says nothing.
- The plaintext `jsonfile` store now needs `"allow_plaintext_store": true` in the config
  (or the policy); it is the test store.
- A wrong type or an unknown key in `~/.maisecrets/config.json` no longer changes anything
  silently: the strict defaults apply and the session start names the key. A broken machine
  policy file blocks every prompt and names the key.
- Keychain values are stored base64-marked (`b64:`), so umlauts round-trip; entries written
  by earlier versions are still read.
- Every hook run is recorded in `~/.maisecrets/hooks.log` (no value, no command).
- Write, Edit, MultiEdit and NotebookEdit resolve a placeholder in their content like an MCP
  argument (session rule, cap, audit line with the file name); `"resolve_in_files": false`
  turns that off.
- Requires Python 3.11+; without it every prompt is blocked and the message names what to
  install.

### Features

- Write and Edit resolve a placeholder like an MCP argument; Windows run dir without uid (9b1cf00)
- second review round applied - private FIFO dir, shell-context scanner, model-facing texts, policy file, retention (099032d)

### Fixes

- the block notice says a placeholder resolves only where maisecrets is active (e2a1db4)
- the primer allows a value in a file or a command when the user asks for it (1a60541)
- second-round findings - command-word refusals, no POSIX grants, private tmp run dir, config fallback, keychain line limit, hooks.log (71e2826)

## [0.3.21] - 2026-09-26

### Features

- Codex on Windows runs the hooks through a PowerShell launcher (c8d0606)

### Fixes

- the Codex launcher is a batch file, run as cmd.exe /C like Codex does (e7bd8d2)

## [0.3.20] - 2026-09-26

### Fixes

- the up-front read tests accept the resolver form Git Bash uses (061258b)
- fail closed on the plugin's own faults and deliver Bash values through a FIFO read up front in the main shell (9170416)

## [0.3.19] - 2026-09-26

### Features

- /maisecrets:send sends the kept rewritten prompt without a clipboard; a failed resolve terminates the command; a grant serves retries; a copied nonce is denied (caf0a98)

### Fixes

- retry the atomic replace while another process reads the index (WinError 5 under concurrency) (4f671dd)
- the lock is taken per index mutation, not for a process's life; the Codex harness preloads in a subprocess; tests keep the open lock file; the release gate steps aside when main moved on (c723767)
- hook processes running at once no longer break each other: per-process temp files, one lock per vault home, unique scrub temp names (6b0ab8c)

## [0.3.18] - 2026-09-26

### Fixes

- the blocked prompt and an MCP resolve are scrubbed from the transcript by a detached child that waits for the record; the harness now really checks transcripts (353643b)

## [0.3.17] - 2026-09-26

### Fixes

- drop the root plugin.json, with it Codex discovered none of the four hooks; the Codex harness installs the plugin through Codex's own discovery (723bb8f)

## [0.3.16] - 2026-09-26

### Fixes

- a labelled value counts from 8 characters, said in the tip and the README (97701a0)

## [0.3.15] - 2026-09-26

### Features

- bare token prefixes live in rules/prefixes.txt, one line each, extended by pull request; CONTRIBUTING.md (4a66d5c)

## [0.3.14] - 2026-09-26

### Fixes

- Cloudflare user API tokens (cfut_) are a secret shape when bare; gitleaks 8.30 needs the word cloudflare and an assignment sign (e17ff23)

## [0.3.13] - 2026-09-26

### Features

- one short tip per day at session start (label a password, /maisecrets:put, session rule, report, audit); off with tips=false (8d6a66c)

## [0.3.12] - 2026-09-26

### Features

- German credential labels (passwort, kennwort, geheimnis, schluessel, zugangsdaten); /maisecrets:put stores the clipboard value and hands back the placeholder (3b67aaa)

## [0.3.11] - 2026-09-26

### Fixes

- release token recreated after the namespace move dropped every project access token; GitLab stays under the personal namespace (cbe8995)

## [0.3.10] - 2026-09-26

### Features

- /maisecrets:report bug <text> and feature <text> open a prefilled issue without a detection event (bb07a67)

## [0.3.9] - 2026-09-26

### Fixes

- a span that contains a placeholder is never a hit (curl -u app:⟦SECRET_c1⟧ minted a second reference); README opens with what the user sees (bd1e9b3)

## [0.3.8] - 2026-09-26

### Fixes

- every file read names UTF-8; the audit-log test read the file with the platform encoding and failed on windows-latest (254cc36)

## [0.3.7] - 2026-09-26

### Features

- notify the claude.ai organisation marketplace from the tag pipeline with a signed push event (41da293)

## [0.3.6] - 2026-09-26

### Fixes

- webhook signing secrets (whsec_) are a secret shape; a bare one on its own line passed. References are numbered in text order (3a9ce0b)

## [0.3.5] - 2026-09-26

### Fixes

- drop userConfig, which Claude Code 2.1.223 rejects as an invalid manifest and then loads no hook at all; the harness fails when the plugin did not load (29e75d9)

## [0.3.4] - 2026-09-26

### Fixes

- a fixed-length secret shape is extended to the end of the token run; harnesses check the marker tail (56b3a92)

## [0.3.3] - 2026-09-26

### Features

- /maisecrets:report and maisecrets report open a prefilled GitHub issue from the last detection event, never with a value (991d1de)

## [0.3.2] - 2026-09-26

### Fixes

- the creating session always may resolve an entry, also for entries written before the sessions list existed (b649f66)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-26

### Fixes

- while the major is 0, feat and fix bump the last number and only a breaking change bumps the middle one (6fc978f)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-26

### Features

- session-bound references, one-time grants for Bash, MCP argument resolution, exact-match redaction, limiter and audit log (f337394)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-26

### Features

- release job derives the version from commit subjects, tags, and mirrors main and tags to GitHub over a deploy key (52eacb2)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-26

- Day-1 prototype: detector (patterns from an earlier internal scrubber), placeholder
  tokens `<TYPE_cN:display>`, vault with TTL and metadata index (jsonfile and
  macOS keychain backends), three Claude Code hooks, harness with a fake
  Anthropic upstream, 4 scenarios, golden hook payload shapes.
- Detector as data: gitleaks, Presidio and detect-secrets rulesets vendored;
  placeholder `⟦TYPE_cN:display⟧` aligned with the gateway; keychain, Credential
  Locker and encrypted-file backends with TTL; Codex adapter; harnesses for
  Claude Code and Codex against fake upstreams.

From 0.2.0 on, every section above is generated by `scripts/release.py` from the
commit subjects since the previous tag.
