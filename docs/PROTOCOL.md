# maisecrets protocol (draft 0)

This document is the specification that a client (hook plugin) and an
execution point (a gateway) share. The plugin repo owns it; a gateway
implements it.

## 1. Placeholder

`⟦TYPE_cN⟧` or `⟦TYPE_cN:display⟧` (brackets U+27E6/U+27E7, mask character
U+2022 in the display). Chosen by measurement against real parsers: `<…>` vanishes in HTML and is a shell redirection, `[…]`
is a Jira link and a regex class, `***` is a regex quantifier; `⟦…⟧` with
`•` survives CommonMark, HTML, XHTML, URL query, regex and SQL LIKE.

- `TYPE` is one of `SECRET`, `EMAIL`, `IBAN`, `CARD`, `IP`, `PHONE`.
- `c` marks a client-minted reference. A server mints `⟦TYPE_N⟧` or `⟦TYPE_N:display⟧` without `c`
  and never mints the `c` range, so the two never collide.
- `N` is a per-client, per-type counter. It is never derived from the value.
- Resolution matches the key `TYPE_cN` only. The display part is for humans
  and may be dropped or altered by a model.
- The gateway treats a `⟦…⟧` token as its own only when the display part is
  empty or is itself a display (a fixed point of the mask transformation); a
  real value in token form is still scanned.
- The earlier `<TYPE_cN>` form is recognised for rehydration, never minted.
- The display rules (`maisecrets/pii_display.py`): e-mail shows at most two
  characters of the local part and, for a non-freemail domain, only the
  top-level label; phone shows the first two digits and the last two; card the
  last four; IBAN the first and last four; IPv4 the first two octets; IPv6 the
  first two hextets before `::`. A display hides at least three characters and
  always carries a bullet; a value the rules cannot mask gets no display.
- A gateway that resolves placeholders itself answers a client reference it
  cannot resolve with an error instead of calling the API with the literal
  text.

## 2. Vault entry

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| key | `TYPE_cN` |
| type, kind | placeholder type; detector pattern name |
| fingerprint | HMAC-SHA256(store key, value)[:16], for "same value, same reference", exact-match redaction and records |
| display | human hint, never for secrets |
| created, last_used, uses | audit |
| expires, max_expires | TTL, renewed on use up to the cap |
| purged | value deleted; metadata kept |

A value never leaves the backend except into (a) a tool's arguments at
execution time, (b) `maisecrets get` for a human.

## 3. Rehydration at the client

`PreToolUse` on `Bash`: the command is prefixed with one read per key into a
shell variable (`__ms_1="$(cat <fifo>)" || exit 97;` on POSIX, a resolver call
under a one-time grant on Windows Git Bash), and every `⟦TYPE_cN⟧` becomes that
variable in its quoting context. The value is never in the command text. A
context the rewrite cannot place (a nested shell, a quoted heredoc, `$'…'`,
backticks) and a command that would encode, slice or trace the value are
refused with the reason. Unknown, expired, foreign-session or capped
references deny the call with a reason that names the key and the status.
Partial resolution never happens.

`PreToolUse` on an MCP tool: every string argument is walked; references are
resolved inline under the same session rule and cap. A server-range token (§4) in an MCP argument stays as it is.

Session rule: a reference resolves only in the session that minted it or in
one where a human typed it into a prompt (`UserPromptSubmit` admits it).

`PostToolUse`: every string in `tool_response` is scanned by shape, and every
token (and the rest of a `KEY=value` line) is compared by keyed fingerprint
with the live entries; hits become references (existing reference when the
fingerprint is known). The response keeps its shape.

## 4. Vault references

Status: draft. Built in the client (`maisecrets/vault_refs.py`); the field and header names are
provisional until the IANA registries are checked.

A server can keep a value away from the model: it puts a token of the server
range (§1, `⟦TYPE_N⟧` or `⟦TYPE_N:display⟧`) into its tool result and keeps the
value. This section lets a vault on the person's computer get that value back
for a local Write, Edit or Bash call, so that the model still sees only the
token. A client without a vault sees what it saw before. The server gives a
value only to a key that the vault announced when the person logged in.

### 4.1 The key and the header

- The vault makes a random 32-byte key `K` per server origin and per client
  profile. It stores `K` like a vault entry, but no placeholder names it, so no
  tool call can resolve it. Two profiles, or two origins, never share a `K`;
  two servers on one origin share it.
- The vault announces `kid = SHA-256(K)` in a static header on the server's
  entry in the client configuration. The header is an RFC 9651 Dictionary:

  ```
  Client-Vault: v=1, kid=:<standard base64 of the 32 bytes, with padding>:
  ```

- The vault writes the header only on an entry of user scope, never on a
  project file that a repository carries and never on an entry that it cannot
  edit. The URL of the entry must be `https`.
- The write changes one key of the configuration file. The vault takes the
  client's own lock (a `<file>.lock` folder; a lock older than 10 s is stale),
  reads the file again, writes a temporary file in the same folder and renames
  it over the original. It does not change a file that is not valid JSON, and
  it keeps a backup. The person can turn this off (`client_header: false`).
  The vault then removes its own header.
- `K` never travels on the MCP connection. It goes only to the resolve
  endpoint (§4.4).

### 4.2 The binding on the server

1. **At login.** The client sends its static headers on the OAuth token
   request too (measured with one client; a client that does not is bound by
   path 2). The server reads `Client-Vault` on the request with
   `grant_type=authorization_code` and binds the `kid` to the subject at once.
   That request needs the PKCE verifier of the login that the person did, so a
   stolen access or refresh token cannot use this path.
2. **On an MCP request.** A `kid` that is not yet bound and arrives on an MCP
   request becomes `pending`. The server tells the subject on a channel that
   the agent does not control. The binding becomes active after a cool-down
   (24 hours in the first server) or earlier when the person confirms. The
   notice lets the person revoke it.

Rules for every binding:

- One `kid` belongs to one subject, ever. If a bound or pending `kid` arrives
  with a second subject, the server binds nothing, revokes both records and
  tells both subjects.
- The server stores `kid` only, never `K`. It compares `SHA-256(K)` with the
  stored `kid` in constant time, and it never logs `K`.
- The server limits the number of active `kid`s per subject and the number
  of values per day, writes one audit line per value released, and makes a
  revoke take effect at once.

### 4.3 Finding the endpoint

The vault reads the protected resource metadata of the MCP URL (RFC 9728),
`GET <origin>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource<path of the MCP URL>`, and
takes the field `client_vault_endpoint`: an absolute URL. If the field is
missing from a 200 answer, the server does not support vault references.
Any other status is a failure, not an answer, and the vault does not keep it.
If the URL is not `https` or its origin differs from the origin of the MCP
URL, the vault does not resolve. The vault may keep the answer per origin for
a time (an hour in maisecrets). The path keeps a trailing slash.

### 4.4 The resolve request

```
POST <client_vault_endpoint>
Authorization: Bearer <K, base64url without padding: 43 characters>
Content-Type: application/json

{"now": "2026-10-16T09:00:00Z",
 "refs": [{"key": "EMAIL_1", "seen_at": "2026-10-16T08:58:12Z"}]}
```

- `key` is the token's key without its display part.
- `now` is the client's clock; `seen_at` is when the vault FIRST saw the key
  in a result of that server. Both are ISO 8601 in UTC. A later sighting does
  not move it: when the server mints the key again for another person, a
  later time would pass the server's check with that person's value.
- `TYPE` is `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*`, at most 40 characters (`IPV6_1`).
- At most 100 refs and 64 KB per request.
- The endpoint accepts `K` only. It refuses the client's OAuth token.

The server corrects each `seen_at` by the difference between its own clock
and `now`. If that difference is above 5 minutes, it answers `clock_skew`. A
key whose value the server minted after the corrected `seen_at` is `expired`:
the same key can name another value after the server's mapping restarts.

### 4.5 The answer

All values, or one error for the whole request. Partial resolution never
happens.

| status | body | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | `{"values": {"EMAIL_1": "…"}}` | one string for each requested key |
| 401 | `{"error": "unknown_key"}` | no active `kid` for this `K`, or revoked |
| 403 | `{"error": "pending", "activates_at": "<ISO 8601>"}` | the binding waits for its cool-down |
| 403 | `{"error": "clock_skew"}` | the client's clock is off by more than 5 minutes |
| 404 | `{"error": "unknown_ref"}` | a key is not in the subject's mapping |
| 410 | `{"error": "expired"}` | a key is newer than its `seen_at` |
| 429 | `{"error": "rate_limited"}` and `Retry-After` | the cap is reached |
| 503 | `{"error": "disabled"}` | the server has the feature off |

Every other answer is a deny: any 3xx (the client follows no redirect), any
other status, a body that is not JSON, a `Content-Type` other than
`application/json`, a body above 1 MB, a value that is not a string, a key
missing from a 200 answer.

### 4.6 The client

- **Noting.** After a tool result of an MCP server of user scope, the vault
  notes each server-range token with the origin and the URL of that server,
  the time and the session, per client profile. A token that two servers sent
  is refused, also when the two share an origin. A token resolves only in a
  session that saw it from that server URL, and only for 24 hours after that
  URL first showed it; in any other case the call is denied with that reason.
  An `expired` answer deletes the note of its keys, so the next sighting
  starts the time again. A sighting after the 24 hours starts a new note too,
  for its session only. A key that one server showed with two different
  display parts, in one result or in two, is refused and its note goes: the
  server's mapping changed, and the token may name another person. A token
  that the tool call itself carried is no sighting: a server that repeats its
  query would otherwise give it a new time. The result does not change. A
  token in any other result (a file read, a web page, a project-scope server)
  is not noted.
- **Resolving.** Before a Write, Edit, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit or Bash call,
  the vault looks for noted tokens. It sends one request per origin and puts
  the values in only when every request succeeds; otherwise it denies the call
  and names the reason. A token that was never noted stays text, so a client
  that never noted a token behaves as before. A token noted from two origins
  is refused, because the vault cannot tell which server to ask.
- **Where a value goes.** In Write and Edit content, inline; in Bash, through
  the same shell variable and FIFO as a stored value (§3), so the command
  text holds no value. An MCP argument keeps the token: it goes back to the
  server that minted it.
- **Transport.** TLS with the system's trust store (or a configured CA file),
  host name check, no redirects, no proxy. The whole fetch, metadata and
  resolve, ends within 5.5 s, inside the hook's 7 s watchdog.
- **Limits and audit.** A server value counts in the vault's own limits per
  session and per hour, as `KEY@host`, before the request. One local audit
  line per value: the key with the server's host, the tool and the call.
  Never the value. A value that a later check refuses gets no audit line.
- **Echo.** For one hour, the vault looks for each value a server gave in the
  later tool results of that session, as it does for a stored value, and
  puts the server's token back in its place. To do that it keeps the values
  in its store for that hour. A value under 8 characters or one that reads
  as a word is not looked for: it would change every text that holds it.
- **Paths.** A server value goes into the content of a file tool, never into
  its path. In Bash, a value that names the vault's own folder, a store file,
  an ssh configuration, the client configuration or a file in the client's
  configuration folder is refused, also as a piece of the value
  (`--config=PATH`, `@PATH`, `file://PATH`).
- **Off.** With the opt-out, no token is noted and no noted token resolves.

### 4.7 What this does not stop

An agent that runs as the same user as the vault can read the store and use
`K` (the store backstop is a backstop, not a boundary). The defence against it
is on the server: the cap, the audit line per value, the notice and the
revoke. A token that the model plants, or that a server echoes, still resolves
only to the subject's own current mapping on that server.

### 4.8 Conformance

A server conforms when a client gets these answers:

1. A login with the header binds the `kid`; a resolve with `K` returns the values.
2. An MCP request with a new `kid` gives `pending` with `activates_at`.
3. The client's OAuth token on the endpoint gives `unknown_key`.
4. One `kid` with two subjects gives no value to either.
5. A `seen_at` older than the value gives `expired`; a `now` one day off gives `clock_skew`.
6. A request with one unknown key among known ones gives `unknown_ref` and no value.

The client side is tested against a fake server with both endpoints
(`harness/vault_server.py`, `tests/test_vault_refs.py`).

## 5. Failure rules

- A hook that cannot decide fails closed and says why.
- A timeout is fail-open in Claude Code; the detector must stay a regex in
  milliseconds.
- Nothing a hook prints contains a value. Reasons name keys and counts.
