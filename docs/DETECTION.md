# The detection core

`maisecrets/detection/` is the detector: it finds secrets and personal data in text. It holds no plugin, no home
folder and no reference form of its own. The plugin gives those to it; a library caller can give its own.

## Use it as a library

`pyproject.toml` builds the core as a wheel. It holds `maisecrets/__init__.py` and `maisecrets/detection/` with its
rule data, and no module of the plugin. It needs no other package and runs on Python 3.9 and later. It is not on PyPI:

```bash
python3 -m pip wheel --no-deps -w dist .        # dist/maisecrets-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
python3 -m pip install dist/maisecrets-*.whl
```

The version is the plugin's version (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`); a wheel from `main` or a tag has the released
one. `importlib.metadata.version("maisecrets")` gives it. Without the plugin modules, each argument left `None` takes
no config, no sources and no reference form: a detector from the wheel never reads the home folder.

```python
from maisecrets.detection import Active, Detector, Host, NO_REFERENCES, NO_SOURCES

d = Detector(
    regions=Active(regions=("generic", "de"), languages=("en", "de"), source="mine"),
    sources=NO_SOURCES,          # rules of your own, allow list, term lists, imported values: a Sources object
    references=NO_REFERENCES,    # how the caller writes a reference into text: a References object
    host=Host(user="me", year=2026),
)
for m in d.findings(text, channel="tool", path="notes.txt"):
    print(m.kind, m.type, m.start, m.end)
```

- **Each argument left `None`** takes the plugin's default when the plugin is there: the config of this computer,
  the readers of the home folder (`maisecrets/sources.py`), the placeholder form (`maisecrets/placeholder.py`), and
  this computer's user name and year.
- **A detector with all four given** reads nothing of the host and imports no module of the plugin
  (`tests/test_detection_package.py` shows this in a fresh process).
- **Two detectors in one process** keep their own rule lists, allow lists and caches, also in two threads and one
  inside a scan of the other (`tests/test_detector.py`).
- **A function given as `regions`** is asked when the rules load: the first scan and each `reset()`. A changed config
  takes effect at `reset()`. `regions()` names the regions that the rule list was loaded for.
- **`with d.activate():`** makes every function of the module in this thread use `d`, for a caller (such as a hook)
  that calls `maisecrets.detect.scan` directly.

## The API

`maisecrets.detection.__all__`:

| Name | What |
|---|---|
| `Detector` | A detector with its own configuration: `scan`, `findings`, `rules`, `allow_list`, `explain_allowed`, `regions`, `reset`, `slowest_user_rule`, `activate`. `scan` and `findings` take the text as a `str` (a subclass of `str` too) and raise `TypeError` for anything else, `bytes` and `None` included (since 0.8) |
| `Match` | One hit: `kind` (the rule id), `type`, `value`, `start`, `end`. `start` and `end` count the Unicode code points of the `str` that was scanned, and `text[start:end] == value` |
| `Sources`, `NO_SOURCES` | What a scan takes besides the built-in rules |
| `References`, `NO_REFERENCES` | The reference form of the caller |
| `Host`, `THIS_COMPUTER` | What a scan reads of its computer |
| `Active`, `resolve_regions` | The regions and label languages, and their resolution from a config (`locale=` to give the locale) |
| `user_rule` | A rule of your own, for `Sources.user_rules` (returns a `Rule`) |
| `TYPES` | The type vocabulary: each type a `Match` can carry, with its `family` and `class` (`maisecrets/detection/types.json`) |

The rule tables and the helpers of `core.py` are no API: they change with the rules.

`core.py` keeps four parts in modules of their own, so that each file stays readable: `value_checks.py` (the
checks of a value), `own_rules.py` (`OWN_RULES`, `FALLBACK_RULES`), `text_index.py` (the index of a text and the
test-code check) and `encoded_mail.py` (an address with its @ as %40). `core.py` imports each of their names, so
`core.<name>` is the same object. A patch of such a name on the core does not reach the functions of the part:
patch the module that defines the name.

## The API: the decision of 2026-10-20

The wheel (`pyproject.toml`) makes the core usable without the plugin, so its names carry a promise. Decided by the
maintainer on 2026-10-20 (merge request !160):

| Name | Promise |
|---|---|
| `Detector`, `Match` (`kind`, `type`, `value`, `start`, `end`), `Sources`, `NO_SOURCES`, `References`, `NO_REFERENCES`, `Host`, `THIS_COMPUTER`, `Active`, `resolve_regions` | **stable** |
| `user_rule(id, type, pattern, keywords=(), secret_group=0)` | **stable**: the one way for a caller to make a rule of its own. The id becomes `user:<id>`; a wrong argument raises `ValueError` |
| `Rule` | **no stable constructor**: the type that `user_rule` returns and `Detector.rules()` lists. Of its fields only `id`, `type`, `keywords` and `secret_group` are promised; the other 17 belong to the detector |
| `TYPES` and `maisecrets/detection/types.json` | **stable** as the section "The type vocabulary" says: a listed type and its family stay; a class may be refined in a minor release; new types may come |
| `LazyRegex` | **removed in 0.8** (deprecated in 0.7.0): give `user_rule` the pattern as a string |
| The text of `scan` and `findings` | **a `str`**: anything else raises `TypeError` since 0.8, decided without a `DeprecationWarning` in 0.7. Before, `None`, `b""` and `0` gave no hits and other bytes or numbers raised whatever the first regex raised |
| The offsets of a `Match` | **Unicode code points** of the scanned `str`, `text[start:end] == value`. A UTF-16 caller (JavaScript, Java, .NET) counts a character outside the BMP, such as an emoji, as two units and converts. In a tool result a value hidden by ANSI codes or zero-width characters has the span of its original text, those characters included |
| `maisecrets.detect` and the other old names | **not API**: plugin modules, not in the wheel |
| The hits themselves | **not API**: a patch version may find more or fewer values; `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` and `scripts/compare_bench.py` report how |

**Changes to a stable name go through a deprecation, also before 1.0:** the old form keeps working with a
`DeprecationWarning` for at least one minor version, the changelog says so under "API" (a commit footer
`API: …`, `scripts/release.py`), and only then it goes. A
1.0 of the wheel would freeze the stable names. `region` and `channel` for `user_rule` come only when they are meant
to be carried as API.

**Checks that hold it:** `tests/test_detection_package.py` pins `__all__`, the parameters of `user_rule`, the stable
`Match` fields, a rule of your own found through a `Detector`, the `ValueError` of a wrong argument, that
`LazyRegex` is gone and the `TypeError` of a text that is not a `str`. `tests/test_code_point_offsets.py` pins the
offsets on texts with emoji and combining characters. `scripts/wheel_smoke.py` makes a rule of its own through
`user_rule` in a fresh venv.

## The type vocabulary

`maisecrets/detection/types.json` lists every type that a `Match.type` of a built-in rule or pass can carry, and
`TYPES` is the same list as a read-only mapping:

```python
from maisecrets.detection import TYPES
TYPES["DE_TAX_ID"]       # {"family": "pii", "class": "pii.tax_id"}
TYPES["SECRET"]          # {"family": "secret", "class": "secret"}
```

- **`family`** is `secret` or `pii`. **`class`** is one of the classes of the benchmark (`bench/cases.py`), such as
  `pii.phone`, `pii.national_id` or `pii.bank_account`, or the family alone when the type does not say which kind it
  is (`SECRET`). The benchmark reads its classes from this file (`bench/sources.py`). The classes today are the
  classes of the benchmark, so several types under `pii.national_id` (postcodes, vehicle plates, tax and company
  numbers) are candidates for a finer class later.
- **Stable:** a type that a release lists is not renamed or removed without the deprecation path above. When its
  last rule goes, the entry stays with a `deprecated` field for at least one minor version. The family of a listed
  type never changes.
- **May be refined in a minor release:** the class of a listed type. The changelog names each type whose class moved.
- **May grow in any release:** new types (a new rule, a new region, a vendored rule set that brings a new entity),
  and new optional fields in an entry. A caller handles a type it does not know by its `family` and `class` from
  `TYPES` of the installed version: that version lists every type it emits.
- **Not listed:** the type of a rule of your own (`user_rule`) and of a term list or an imported value of the
  plugin; the caller or the person chose it. The terms and imports of the plugin take listed types only.

`tests/test_type_vocabulary.py` derives the emitted types from the rules of every region and label language and from
the passes, and fails when a type is emitted and not listed, or listed and emitted by nothing (unless it is
`deprecated`). A vendored rule-set update that brings a new type is therefore red until the type gets an entry.

## The JSON entry point: maisecrets.detect/1

A caller in any language runs the core as a process: one JSON request on stdin, one JSON response on stdout.

```bash
python3 -m maisecrets.detection < request.json > response.json
```

It needs Python 3.9 or later and the wheel installed (or the plugin folder as the working directory), and no other
package. It reads no home folder, no config and no network. Each call is one process; it loads the rules of its
request and ends (about 0.1 s on an M-series laptop). A Python server uses the library in process instead.

The schema of the request and of the response is `maisecrets/detection/detect-1.schema.json` (JSON Schema 2020-12,
`$defs/request` and `$defs/response`); it ships in the wheel next to the code. The contract follows
`docs/DETECTION-CONTRACT-PROPOSAL.md`, with the keys the core fills today.

**The request.** A JSON object in UTF-8 (a byte order mark is allowed):

| Key | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `contract` | yes | `"maisecrets.detect/1"` |
| `text` | yes | the text to scan, a string |
| `channel` | yes | `"prompt"` (a person typed it) or `"tool"` (a tool result or a file). The tool channel takes forms a prompt does not, such as a phone number under a key that names a phone |
| `regions` | yes | the country rule sets, such as `["generic", "de"]`: `generic` and the country codes the rules name (`de`, `us`, `uk`, …; an unknown code is an error). `generic` is always on; `[]` gives it alone |
| `languages` | yes | the label languages, such as `["en", "de"]`: the files of `maisecrets/detection/rules/labels/`. English is always on |
| `context.path` | no | the file the text came from: a value of a test file can then be a fixture and no finding |

The order of `regions` and of `languages` does not matter. A key that the table does not name is an error, so a
misspelt key never goes unnoticed. Two keys of the proposal are
not in `maisecrets.detect/1` yet: `context.fields` comes with the `fields` argument of `Detector.findings`, and
`exclusions` has no form in the core today (a reference form is a `References` object of six questions, not a list
of spans). A caller drops a finding inside its own placeholders itself. A later release may accept both as new
optional keys; a request without them keeps its meaning.

```json
{"contract": "maisecrets.detect/1",
 "text": "{\"customer\": {\"telefon\": \"0171 4829173\", \"build_number\": \"20261021\"}}",
 "channel": "tool", "regions": ["generic", "de"], "languages": ["en", "de"]}
```

**The response.** One line of JSON with a fixed key order:

```json
{"contract": "maisecrets.detect/1",
 "engine": {"name": "maisecrets", "version": "0.8.0", "ruleset": "sha256:…"},
 "findings": [{"start": 26, "end": 38, "type": "PHONE",
               "provenance": {"rule": "phone-after-phone-word", "origin": "builtin", "layer": "deterministic"}}]}
```

- **`start` and `end`** count Unicode code points of `text`, `end` exclusive. The value is `text[start:end]`; the
  response never carries it, so a secret stays out of the output stream. A UTF-16 caller (JavaScript, Java, .NET)
  counts a character outside the BMP, such as an emoji, as two units and converts.
- **`type`** is a type of `maisecrets/detection/types.json` (section "The type vocabulary"), with its family and class
  there. The findings are sorted by `start`, `end`, `type` and `rule`, and no two of them overlap.
- **`provenance`** is informative: `rule` is the rule id (`Match.kind`), and it may change with the rules; `origin`
  is `builtin` and `layer` is `deterministic` in this release. There is no confidence.
- **`engine.version`** is the version of the plugin or the wheel. **`engine.ruleset`** is a sha256 over the rule list
  the request loaded (each rule's id, type, pattern, keywords and checks, in scan order), the regions, the label
  languages and the year. It is computed from the loaded rules, not from the files: a checkout with CRLF line ends
  and the release tree give the same digest. The same request, version and ruleset give the same bytes.
- **The year** is the one input from outside the request: a birth date must lie before the current year (UTC). It is
  part of `ruleset`, so the digest changes on 1 January.

**Errors.** An error is a response too, on stdout, with a non-zero exit status. stderr stays empty.

```json
{"contract": "maisecrets.detect/1", "error": {"code": "invalid_request", "path": "regions[1]", "message": "is no known region"}}
```

| `code` | Exit status | When |
|---|---|---|
| `invalid_json` | 2 | the input is not one JSON document in UTF-8, has a key twice in one object, or holds `NaN` |
| `unsupported_contract` | 2 | `contract` is not `maisecrets.detect/1` |
| `invalid_request` | 2 | a required key is missing, a value has the wrong type or is not known, a key is not defined, or the process got arguments; `path` names the field (`channel`, `regions[1]`, `context.path`; `""` for the request itself) |
| `internal_error` | 3 | the engine failed; the message names the class of the exception |

Exit status 0 is a response with findings. Any other status (1 from the interpreter itself, for example when the
package is not found) means no response was written. The message of an error is a fixed text of the engine: it
never holds a value of the request, not even the name of an unknown key, since a key is input as well.

`tests/test_detection_entry_point.py` runs the conformance cases (`tests/conformance/cases.json`) through the entry
point and compares each response with the Python API, checks every response kind and the two examples above against
the schema, runs one request twice in fresh processes and compares the bytes, and sends a secret-shaped value in each
wrong field and checks that no output holds it. `scripts/wheel_smoke.py` calls the entry point from the installed
wheel.

## The old names

`maisecrets.detect` and `maisecrets.checksums`, `lazy_regex`, `normalise`, `regions`, `registry`, `rulespec`,
`rule_filter` and `personal` stay. Each is the same module object as its module in `maisecrets/detection/`, so an
import or a patch through an old name reaches the core itself. The plugin and its tests use them.
`detect.scan()`, `detect.findings()` and the other functions use the default detector, which `use_regions`,
`use_sources` and `use_references` configure.

## The boundary tests

| Test | It holds |
|---|---|
| `tests/test_detection_boundary.py` | No module outside the core uses a private name of the core, by any of its names. A plain scan imports only the plugin modules on a list that may only get shorter. |
| `tests/test_scan_context.py` | A scan writes no new module state; the state left is the per-thread text index and caches that depend on no configuration. |
| `tests/test_detector.py` | Two detectors, their caches, their threads and the snapshot of a rule load. |
| `tests/test_detector_host.py` | An explicit host reads neither the user name nor the clock; an explicit detector gives one result on two hosts. |
| `tests/test_detection_package.py` | The API, the old names, the rule data, and a library caller that imports nothing of the plugin. |
| `tests/test_code_point_offsets.py` | The offsets count code points: emoji and combining characters before, around and inside a value, in a JSON line and in the cleaned copy of a tool result. |
| `tests/test_detection_entry_point.py` | The JSON entry point: the conformance cases through it, the schema, the errors, the bytes of two runs, no value in any output. |
| `tests/test_library_consumer.py` | A server-like caller of the public names only (`examples/library_consumer.py`): its own sources and rules, `reset()`, two detectors in eight threads, a large input, many requests, no file under HOME. |

`scripts/detection_fingerprint.py` records the hits of 27,337 inputs. A change that moves the code and not the rules
leaves the fingerprint byte-identical.

## A language-neutral spec

`docs/DETECTION-SPEC-DRAFT.md` measures how far the core is from a spec that a second implementation could follow:
what is data today, what is Python, about 31 semantic primitives, and a case format that tells normative cases from
snapshot records. It is an analysis; nothing in the runtime depends on it.
