# The detection core

`maisecrets/detection/` is the detector: it finds secrets and personal data in text. It holds no plugin, no home
folder and no reference form of its own. The plugin gives those to it; a library caller can give its own.

## Use it as a library

`pyproject.toml` builds the core as a wheel. It holds `maisecrets/__init__.py` and `maisecrets/detection/` with its
rule data, and no module of the plugin. It needs no other package and runs on Python 3.9 and later. It is on PyPI
since 0.8.28 (`pip install maisecrets`); to build it from the checkout:

```bash
python3 -m pip wheel --no-deps -w dist .        # dist/maisecrets-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
python3 -m pip install dist/maisecrets-*.whl
```

The version is the plugin's version (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`); a wheel from `main` or a tag has the released
one. `importlib.metadata.version("maisecrets")` gives it. Without the plugin modules, each argument left `None` takes
no config, no sources and no reference form: a detector from the wheel never reads the home folder.

```python
from maisecrets.detection import Active, Detector, Host, NO_REFERENCES, NO_SOURCES

d = Detector(
    regions=Active(regions=("generic", "de"), languages=("en", "de"), source="mine"),
    sources=NO_SOURCES,          # rules of your own, allow list, term lists, imported values: a Sources object
    references=NO_REFERENCES,    # how the caller writes a reference into text: a References object
    host=Host(user="me", year=2026),
)
for m in d.findings(text, channel="tool", path="notes.txt"):
    print(m.kind, m.type, m.start, m.end)
```

- **Each argument left `None`** takes the plugin's default when the plugin is there: the config of this computer,
  the readers of the home folder (`maisecrets/sources.py`), the placeholder form (`maisecrets/placeholder.py`), and
  this computer's user name and year.
- **A detector with all four given** reads nothing of the host and imports no module of the plugin
  (`tests/test_detection_package.py` shows this in a fresh process).
- **Two detectors in one process** keep their own rule lists, allow lists and caches, also in two threads and one
  inside a scan of the other (`tests/test_detector.py`).
- **A function given as `regions`** is asked when the rules load: the first scan and each `reset()`. A changed config
  takes effect at `reset()`. `regions()` names the regions that the rule list was loaded for.
- **`with d.activate():`** makes every function of the module in this thread use `d`, for a caller (such as a hook)
  that calls `maisecrets.detect.scan` directly.

## The API

`maisecrets.detection.__all__`:

| Name | What |
|---|---|
| `Detector` | A detector with its own configuration: `scan`, `findings`, `rules`, `allow_list`, `explain_allowed`, `regions`, `reset`, `slowest_user_rule`, `activate`, `label_names_a_number` (since 0.8.30, below), `label_changes_a_number` (since 0.9.6, below). `scan` and `findings` take the text as a `str` (a subclass of `str` too) and raise `TypeError` for anything else, `bytes` and `None` included (since 0.8). A `channel` other than `prompt` or `tool` raises `ValueError` (since 0.9.4). They take an optional keyword argument `fields` (since 0.8, additive): the field names of values in the text, below |
| `Match` | One hit: `kind` (the rule id), `type`, `value`, `start`, `end`. Its `repr()` and `str()` show the rule, the type, the offsets and the length, never the value (since 0.9.4). `start` and `end` count the Unicode code points of the `str` that was scanned, and `text[start:end] == value` |
| `Sources`, `NO_SOURCES` | What a scan takes besides the built-in rules |
| `References`, `NO_REFERENCES` | The reference form of the caller |
| `Host`, `THIS_COMPUTER` | What a scan reads of its computer |
| `Active`, `resolve_regions` | The regions and label languages, and their resolution from a config (`locale=` to give the locale). A `Detector` given an `Active` with a region or a label language that the JSON entry point does not know raises `ValueError`, which names the known codes (since 0.9.4; before, an unknown region was ignored and an unknown language raised `FileNotFoundError`) |
| `user_rule` | A rule of your own, for `Sources.user_rules` (returns a `Rule`) |
| `TYPES` | The type vocabulary: each type a `Match` can carry, with its `family` and `class` (`maisecrets/detection/types.json`) |
| `ScanIncomplete` | Raised by a scan past its `deadline=` (since 0.8.24): `findings`, `reason`, `read`, below |

The rule tables and the helpers of `core.py` are no API: they change with the rules.

`core.py` keeps six parts in modules of their own, so that each file stays readable: `value_checks.py` (the
checks of a value), `own_rules.py` (`OWN_RULES`, `FALLBACK_RULES`), `text_index.py` (the index of a text and the
test-code check), `encoded_mail.py` (an address with its @ as %40), `keyword_tail.py` (the vendored keyword
rules in linear time) and `deadline.py` (the deadline of a scan and `ScanIncomplete`). `core.py` imports each of their names, so
`core.<name>` is the same object. `Detector` inherits `label_names_a_number` from `label_number.py`. A patch of such a name on the core does not reach the functions of the part:
patch the module that defines the name.

## A label that names a number: `label_names_a_number` (since 0.8.30)

A caller that scans numbers only up to a cap (the gateway scans at most 2,000 numbers of a response) must still scan a
number whose label can make it personal data. `Detector.label_names_a_number(label)` says which labels those are:

```python
from maisecrets.detection import leaves
d.label_names_a_number(leaves.label(("customer", "steuer_id")))   # True with the region "de"
d.label_names_a_number("order_id")                                 # False
```

- **`label`** is the string that `leaves.label(path)` returns for a leaf. A label that is not a `str` raises
  `TypeError`; `""` (no label) is False.
- **False** means: a digit-only value of 7 to 19 digits under this label gives no finding that the same digits give
  without the label. **True** means: an active rule can read such a number because of the label (a tax id, a phone
  number, a national id, a social security or health insurance number, a number after an id label, a rule of your
  own with a label in its regex). A label that gives a finding only for some numbers is True.
- **It follows the detector:** its regions, its label languages and its rules of your own. `steuer_id` is True with
  the region `de` and False without it.
- **How it answers:** the rules themselves are asked, not a copy of their words. `label_number.SAMPLES` holds one
  recipe per rule that reads a digit-only value only after a label: a length, first digits and the check of the core
  the value must pass (`de-tax-id` passes the tax id checksum, `phone-after-phone-word` is a national number). The
  values are made at run time. A label is True when one sample under it gives a finding that the bare sample does not
  give, in the field form (`fields=` with the path `(label,)`) or in the text form `label: <value>` of
  `findings_by_leaf`, in the tool or the prompt channel. Measured over the 2,747 words of the test's word pool (regions
  generic, de and us), the two forms differ for one word only (`cc `, text form alone); in the test's discovery the
  prompt channel adds one finding the tool channel does not give (a 16-digit card number after a card word). A rule of
  your own has no recipe: its samples are the digit runs its own regex can match, scanned with those rules.
- **Cost:** the first call for a label scans the samples (about 1 to 160 ms on an M-series laptop, median about 36 ms
  for a False label: a True label stops at the first sample that gives a finding); each later call is a dictionary
  lookup. The answers live with the detector until `reset()`, at most `label_number.ANSWERS_MAX` (4,096) labels; the
  oldest goes first. A caller whose keys change with every response (dates, ids) pays the first call for each new
  key: bound the new labels per response. It never scans a value of the caller.
- **A list index given as a string** (`phones.0` split at the dots into `("phones", "0")`) is no key since 0.8.30:
  `leaves.label` gives the key above it, `phones`, as for an int index.
- **What it cannot see:** a rule whose label-only finding needs a value that no recipe makes (a recipe gives one
  value per rule; a rule whose own filters accept only some values of a shape can refuse it), a rule of your own whose
  regex the sampler does not read (it takes the first 8 alternatives of an alternation and skips assertions and back
  references), and a finding that needs more context than the label (a word in a neighbouring field).
- `tests/test_label_number.py` holds the pinned labels, the regions, a rule of your own, the cache, and the
  completeness check: it finds the rules that read a digit-only value only after a label from the rules' own data
  (each rule's regex and check, its context and keywords, the label files and the word tables of `personal.py`), and
  fails on a rule without a recipe, on a recipe its rule does not read, and on a rule of a number type that has
  neither a recipe nor a reason in `NEVER_LABEL_ONLY`.


### Both directions: `label_changes_a_number` (since 0.9.6)

`label_names_a_number` answers one direction: whether a label adds a finding. A label can also take one away: a
16-digit number that passes the Luhn check is a card bare, and no card under `id`, `order_id`, `uuid` or `ref`. A
caller that takes the findings of a number under one label for the same number under another label needs both
directions (ai-gateway #1822: a card under `id` stayed in clear). `Detector.label_changes_a_number(label)` is True
when a digit-only value of 7 to 19 digits under the label gives other findings than bare: one more, one fewer or
another. False means the findings are the same under the label and bare.

```python
d.label_changes_a_number("series")      # False: a series of numbers is no label of a number
d.label_changes_a_number("id")          # True: a card under `id` is no card (label_names_a_number("id") is False)
```

It asks the same samples in the same forms and channels as `label_names_a_number`, and a Luhn-valid number of each
card length from 13 to 19 digits (`label_number.bare_samples()`), which rules find bare. A label for which
`label_names_a_number` is True is True here too. `""` is False, and the answer is cached per label until `reset()`.

## Field names: `fields` (since 0.8)

A caller that has the structure of its data (a JSON response walked with a field path, a key-value record) can give
the field name of a value with the text, instead of the core guessing it back from the text:

```python
d.findings("0171 4829173", channel="tool", fields=[(0, 12, ("customer", "telefon"))])   # one PHONE, 0-12
d.findings("0171 4829173", channel="tool")                                            # no hit
```

- **The shape:** a list or tuple of `(start, end, name)`. `start` and `end` are the span of the value in code points
  of the text, `0 <= start < end <= len(text)`; `name` is the field path, outermost first, a tuple (or list) of `str`
  and `int` parts. A wrong shape raises `TypeError`, an offset outside the text `ValueError`; the message names the
  position (`fields[1]`) and never a part of the text or of a name. Fields may overlap.
- **What a name does:** it is evidence as the same label before the value in text is, and only that. The last part of
  the path that is no list index is put before a copy of the value (`telefon: <value>`) and that line is scanned with
  the rules of the call. A hit inside the value is added when the bare value has none there and the scan of the whole
  text has none there either (`maisecrets/detection/fields.py`). Two parts of a name are read for what they name
  (since 0.8.26, ai-gateway #1764): a last part that only wraps the value (`value`, `number`, `nummer`, `wert`)
  takes the name above it (`("phone", 0, "value")`, `("contact", "phone", "number")`, `("steuer_id", "value")`), and a
  phone word with qualifiers only (`phone_home`, `telefon_privat`, `mobileBusiness`, `phone_cell`, `phoneNumbers`) is
  the phone word. A name with another word (`phone_type`, `phone_country_code`, `mobile_app_version`) stays as it is.
- **What it never does:** take a hit away (the hits of the text stay as they are), add a hit outside its span, bring
  back a hit that the text around the value took away, or parse anything: the core reads JSON and the other formats of
  the text itself, as without fields. A field that names what the core read itself adds no second hit.
- **Names that add nothing:** a name the label rules give no evidence for (`id`, `value`, `data`, `title`, an unknown
  word), `key` alone (in API data it names a ticket key, an object key or a translation key as often as a credential;
  `api_key`, `secret_key` are labels as in text, and so is `token` alone), the cursor of a paged list
  (`nextPageToken`, `syncToken`, `continuationToken`, `purchaseToken`; not `PrevAuthToken`), and a name with a line
  break, `:`, `=` or a quote, or longer than 64 characters. `build_number` stays text.
- **Without `fields`** (or with an empty list) a scan is the one of before: `scripts/detection_fingerprint.py` gives
  the same bytes. Each field costs two scans of its value, one with the label and one bare. In `findings()` with no
  `path`, a field over the whole text costs one, since the scan of the text is its bare scan; `scan(..., fields=)`
  scans twice.
- `tests/test_detection_fields.py` holds these points; `tests/conformance/cases.json` has cases with
  `context.fields` in the gateway's shapes (a leaf with its field path, and a JSON text with fields of its own keys).

## The API: the decision of 2026-10-20

The wheel (`pyproject.toml`) makes the core usable without the plugin, so its names carry a promise. Decided by the
maintainer on 2026-10-20 (merge request !160):

| Name | Promise |
|---|---|
| `Detector`, `Match` (`kind`, `type`, `value`, `start`, `end`), `Sources`, `NO_SOURCES`, `References`, `NO_REFERENCES`, `Host`, `THIS_COMPUTER`, `Active`, `resolve_regions` | **stable** |
| `user_rule(id, type, pattern, keywords=(), secret_group=0)` | **stable**: the one way for a caller to make a rule of its own. The id becomes `user:<id>`; a wrong argument raises `ValueError` |
| `Rule` | **no stable constructor**: the type that `user_rule` returns and `Detector.rules()` lists. Of its fields only `id`, `type`, `keywords` and `secret_group` are promised; the other 17 belong to the detector |
| `TYPES` and `maisecrets/detection/types.json` | **stable** as the section "The type vocabulary" says: a listed type and its family stay; a class may be refined in a minor release; new types may come |
| `ScanIncomplete` and `deadline=` | **provisional** (since 0.8.24, for the gateway's time budget): the names may change in a minor release, until the maintainer decides |
| `LazyRegex` | **removed in 0.8** (deprecated in 0.7.0): give `user_rule` the pattern as a string |
| The text of `scan` and `findings` | **a `str`**: anything else raises `TypeError` since 0.8, decided without a `DeprecationWarning` in 0.7. Before, `None`, `b""` and `0` gave no hits and other bytes or numbers raised whatever the first regex raised |
| The offsets of a `Match` | **Unicode code points** of the scanned `str`, `text[start:end] == value`. A UTF-16 caller (JavaScript, Java, .NET) counts a character outside the BMP, such as an emoji, as two units and converts. In a tool result a value hidden by ANSI codes or zero-width characters has the span of its original text, those characters included |
| `maisecrets.detect` and the other old names | **not API**: plugin modules, not in the wheel |
| The hits themselves | **not API**: a patch version may find more or fewer values; `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` and `scripts/compare_bench.py` report how |

**Changes to a stable name go through a deprecation, also before 1.0:** the old form keeps working with a
`DeprecationWarning` for at least one minor version, the changelog says so under "API" (a commit footer
`API: …`, `scripts/release.py`), and only then it goes. A
1.0 of the wheel would freeze the stable names. `region` and `channel` for `user_rule` come only when they are meant
to be carried as API.

**Checks that hold it:** `tests/test_detection_package.py` pins `__all__`, the parameters of `user_rule`, the stable
`Match` fields, a rule of your own found through a `Detector`, the `ValueError` of a wrong argument, that
`LazyRegex` is gone and the `TypeError` of a text that is not a `str`. `tests/test_code_point_offsets.py` pins the
offsets on texts with emoji and combining characters. `scripts/wheel_smoke.py` makes a rule of its own through
`user_rule` in a fresh venv.

## The type vocabulary

`maisecrets/detection/types.json` lists every type that a `Match.type` of a built-in rule or pass can carry, and
`TYPES` is the same list as a read-only mapping:

```python
from maisecrets.detection import TYPES
TYPES["DE_TAX_ID"]       # {"family": "pii", "class": "pii.tax_id"}
TYPES["SECRET"]          # {"family": "secret", "class": "secret"}
```

- **`family`** is `secret` or `pii`. **`class`** is one of the classes of the benchmark (`bench/cases.py`), such as
  `pii.phone`, `pii.national_id` or `pii.bank_account`, or the family alone when the type does not say which kind it
  is (`SECRET`). The benchmark reads its classes from this file (`bench/sources.py`). The classes today are the
  classes of the benchmark, so several types under `pii.national_id` (postcodes, vehicle plates, tax and company
  numbers) are candidates for a finer class later.
- **Stable:** a type that a release lists is not renamed or removed without the deprecation path above. When its
  last rule goes, the entry stays with a `deprecated` field for at least one minor version. The family of a listed
  type never changes.
- **May be refined in a minor release:** the class of a listed type. The changelog names each type whose class moved.
- **May grow in any release:** new types (a new rule, a new region, a vendored rule set that brings a new entity),
  and new optional fields in an entry. A caller handles a type it does not know by its `family` and `class` from
  `TYPES` of the installed version: that version lists every type it emits.
- **Not listed:** the type of a rule of your own (`user_rule`) and of a term list or an imported value of the
  plugin; the caller or the person chose it. The terms and imports of the plugin take listed types only.

`tests/test_type_vocabulary.py` derives the emitted types from the rules of every region and label language and from
the passes, and fails when a type is emitted and not listed, or listed and emitted by nothing (unless it is
`deprecated`). A vendored rule-set update that brings a new type is therefore red until the type gets an entry.

## The JSON entry point: maisecrets.detect/1

A caller in any language runs the core as a process: one JSON request on stdin, one JSON response on stdout.

```bash
python3 -m maisecrets.detection < request.json > response.json
```

It needs Python 3.9 or later and the wheel installed (or the plugin folder as the working directory), and no other
package. It reads no home folder, no config and no network. Each call is one process; it loads the rules of its
request and ends (about 0.1 s on an M-series laptop). A Python server uses the library in process instead.

The schema of the request and of the response is `maisecrets/detection/detect-1.schema.json` (JSON Schema 2020-12,
`$defs/request` and `$defs/response`); it ships in the wheel next to the code. The contract follows
`docs/DETECTION-CONTRACT-PROPOSAL.md`, with the keys the core fills today.

**The request.** A JSON object in UTF-8 (a byte order mark is allowed):

| Key | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `contract` | yes | `"maisecrets.detect/1"` |
| `text` | yes | the text to scan, a string |
| `channel` | yes | `"prompt"` (a person typed it) or `"tool"` (a tool result or a file). The tool channel takes forms a prompt does not, such as a phone number under a key that names a phone |
| `regions` | yes | the country rule sets, such as `["generic", "de"]`: `generic` and the country codes the rules name (`de`, `us`, `uk`, …; an unknown code is an error). `generic` is always on; `[]` gives it alone |
| `languages` | yes | the label languages, such as `["en", "de"]`: the files of `maisecrets/detection/rules/labels/`. English is always on |
| `context.path` | no | the file the text came from: a value of a test file can then be a fixture and no finding |
| `context.fields` | no | the field names of values in the text: a list of `{"start", "end", "name", "format"}`, the span of a value in code points, its field path outermost first (strings and integers, at least one part) and an informative format. It is the `fields` argument of `Detector.findings` ("Field names" above): evidence as a label, never a finding taken away. A wrong field is an error with the path `context.fields[i]…` |

The order of `regions` and of `languages` does not matter. A key that the table does not name is an error, so a
misspelt key never goes unnoticed. One key of the proposal is
not in `maisecrets.detect/1` yet: `exclusions` has no form in the core today (a reference form is a `References` object of six questions, not a list
of spans). A caller drops a finding inside its own placeholders itself. A later release may accept it as a new
optional key; a request without them keeps its meaning.

```json
{"contract": "maisecrets.detect/1",
 "text": "{\"customer\": {\"telefon\": \"0171 4829173\", \"build_number\": \"20261021\"}}",
 "channel": "tool", "regions": ["generic", "de"], "languages": ["en", "de"]}
```

**The response.** One line of JSON with a fixed key order:

```json
{"contract": "maisecrets.detect/1",
 "engine": {"name": "maisecrets", "version": "0.8.0", "ruleset": "sha256:…"},
 "findings": [{"start": 26, "end": 38, "type": "PHONE",
               "provenance": {"rule": "phone-after-phone-word", "origin": "builtin", "layer": "deterministic"}}]}
```

- **`start` and `end`** count Unicode code points of `text`, `end` exclusive. The value is `text[start:end]`; the
  response never carries it, so a secret stays out of the output stream. A UTF-16 caller (JavaScript, Java, .NET)
  counts a character outside the BMP, such as an emoji, as two units and converts.
- **`type`** is a type of `maisecrets/detection/types.json` (section "The type vocabulary"), with its family and class
  there. The findings are sorted by `start`, `end`, `type` and `rule`, and no two of them overlap.
- **`provenance`** is informative: `rule` is the rule id (`Match.kind`), and it may change with the rules; `origin`
  is `builtin` and `layer` is `deterministic` in this release. There is no confidence.
- **`engine.version`** is the version of the plugin or the wheel. **`engine.ruleset`** is a sha256 over the rule list
  the request loaded (each rule's id, type, pattern, keywords and checks, in scan order), the regions, the label
  languages and the year. It is computed from the loaded rules, not from the files: a checkout with CRLF line ends
  and the release tree give the same digest. The same request, version and ruleset give the same bytes.
- **The year** is the one input from outside the request: a birth date must lie before the current year (UTC). It is
  part of `ruleset`, so the digest changes on 1 January.

**Errors.** An error is a response too, on stdout, with a non-zero exit status. stderr stays empty.

```json
{"contract": "maisecrets.detect/1", "error": {"code": "invalid_request", "path": "regions[1]", "message": "is no known region"}}
```

| `code` | Exit status | When |
|---|---|---|
| `invalid_json` | 2 | the input is not one JSON document in UTF-8, has a key twice in one object, or holds `NaN` |
| `unsupported_contract` | 2 | `contract` is not `maisecrets.detect/1` |
| `invalid_request` | 2 | a required key is missing, a value has the wrong type or is not known, a key is not defined, or the process got arguments; `path` names the field (`channel`, `regions[1]`, `context.path`; `""` for the request itself) |
| `internal_error` | 3 | the engine failed; the message names the class of the exception |

Exit status 0 is a response with findings. Any other status (1 from the interpreter itself, for example when the
package is not found) means no response was written. The message of an error is a fixed text of the engine: it
never holds a value of the request, not even the name of an unknown key, since a key is input as well.

`tests/test_detection_entry_point.py` runs the conformance cases (`tests/conformance/cases.json`) through the entry
point and compares each response with the Python API, checks every response kind and the two examples above against
the schema, runs one request twice in fresh processes and compares the bytes, and sends a secret-shaped value in each
wrong field and checks that no output holds it. `scripts/wheel_smoke.py` calls the entry point from the installed
wheel.

## A parsed object: findings per string, few scans (since 0.8.10, provisional)

A caller that holds a parsed response (a `dict` from an API) can scan each string in it apart, after its key. A call
has a fixed cost of about 0.6 ms, and a gateway response has 69 strings on average (prod, 7 days, 2026-11-02), so
most of the time goes to the calls. `maisecrets.detection.leaves.findings_by_leaf` scans fewer texts and gives each
finding back in the coordinates of its string:

```python
from maisecrets.detection.leaves import findings_by_leaf
for leaf, m in findings_by_leaf(detector, response):     # layout "lines", the default since 0.8.11
    leaf.path, leaf.value[m.start:m.end], m.type          # path: dict keys and list indices, outermost first
```

- **numbers=True** (since 0.9.6): an integer of 13 to 19 digits (the length of a card number) is a leaf too, as the
  string of its digits, found in the same scans; a card stored as a number then comes back with its path. Without it
  a number is never a leaf. Scan such numbers this way, not each apart: a call has a fixed cost, and a metric series
  of 2,680 epoch-ms timestamps scanned one by one took 1.7 s, in one call with `numbers=True` 0.09 s (Apple M5, the
  answer of ai-gateway #1822, 2026-11-11). A short text scanned alone costs less since 0.9.6 too (it walks only the
  rules its alphabet allows), but the cost per call stays.
- **layout "lines"** (the default since 0.8.11): one scan per record, each string on a line of its own after its last
  key, as written. A record is an item of the outermost list on a string's path; the strings in no list are one record
  of their own. So the scan of a string sees what a scan of that string after its key sees, plus the other strings
  of its record (`last_name` next to `first_name`), and nothing of another record. On the shapes of the gateway's
  check (a line break, JSON inside a string, a context word in a neighbouring record) it finds what each string
  alone after its key finds (`tests/test_detection_leaves.py`, `LinesLayoutTests`).
  A context of one field that speaks against a finding (a test marker, a company word, a template) counts only
  inside that field (`tests/test_record_negative_context.py`). `leaves.RECORD_CONTEXT_PER_FIELD` names the level of
  this guarantee and moves up each time a window that crossed a field is closed: 2 since 0.8.18 (the street after
  its label). A release without the constant is below 2.
  A string that its record already holds after the same label (Slack writes each message twice, in `text` and in
  `blocks`) is scanned once, and the copy gets the findings of the first (since 0.8.18).
  A value in an inline node of its own after a cue node (since 0.8.18): the text nodes of an Atlassian document
  paragraph are scanned also as one sentence, and the findings are cut into the nodes; a value found in one string
  of a response is masked in the other strings that hold it as a whole word (Slack's bold or code element after
  `Passwort: ` in its blocks, found from the message's text field). A name or user name spreads with two words or
  more, any other value with 8 to 256 characters, a letter and a digit and none of the common shapes (a date or a time,
  `host:port`, `file:line`, `__name__`, `@Annotation`, a ticket key, a version): one word (Wolf, Sommer, a word after
  `password:`) is also a word of other strings. A string whose key
  names no secret (a cursor, `component_key`, a lone `key`, an id, `token_expires_at`, a revision) gets no spread.
- **layout "json"** (the default of 0.8.10): one scan of `json.dumps(obj, ensure_ascii=False)`. In that text a line
  break is the two characters `\n` and a quote gets a backslash, so an address can run over a line end and a label
  inside a string is lost; and a context word of one record can give a finding in the next. The gateway's check of
  0.8.10 found 4 such differences in 48 cases. `json_text(obj)` gives that text with the place of each string.
- **The name of a person's role** (since 0.8.12): under `author`, `reviewer(s)`, `assignee(s)`, `reporter`,
  `creator`, `organizer`, `attendee(s)`, `committer`, `approver`, `requester`, `merge_user`, `merged_by`, `closed_by`,
  `approved_by` and `requested_by`, the key `name`, `displayName` or `fullName` is written as `<role>_name`
  (`author_name: …`), a person label of the core: a full name whose surname is also an English word is found there,
  which after the weak `name` read as words. A value with a word of an account, a group or a state (Deleted User,
  Platform Team, Plattform Mannschaft) stays text after such a key, in a scan of text too.
- **The label** of a string is its last key, unless that key could change the label line: a key that is empty or
  longer than 64 characters, holds a line boundary (`\r`, U+2028 and the others of `str.splitlines`) or a control
  character, holds one of `: = | " '`, or names the cursor of a paged list (`nextPageToken`, as the gateway). Such a
  string stands on its line without a label, and starts a scan of its own: after another string, that string's last
  line (`password:`) would read as its label. `leaves.label(path)` gives the label of a path, "" for none (since
  0.8.16; `_label` stays an alias).
- **A span** is one of the string as the caller holds it; `m.value` is `leaf.value[m.start:m.end]`. A finding in a
  key, a label or the structure belongs to no string (`leaf` is None); one that runs past the end of its string is cut
  there; a span of length zero stays one, also at the end of a string. A string that is empty or white space only
  is not scanned and does not cut its record (it holds nothing to find). Placing the findings is
  one pass over the strings and the findings. A value JSON cannot hold raises `TypeError`, a cycle `ValueError`.
- `tests/test_detection_leaves.py` holds these points.
  So a password and a first and last name reach such an element; a single surname alone in it stays as it is.

## A deadline: stop a scan in time (since 0.8.24)

`Detector.findings(text, ..., deadline=)`, `Detector.findings_with(text, ..., deadline=)` and
`leaves.findings_by_leaf(detector, obj, ..., deadline=)` take a `time.monotonic()` value. Without it nothing changes.
`findings_with()` bounds both its steps by it: the rules as `findings()` does (since 0.9.4; before, only the remote
step), and the remote request.

Past the deadline the scan stops between rules, between the hits of a rule (since 0.8.25), between its steps (the
personal data, the cleaned copy, the terms) and between record segments. It raises `maisecrets.detection.ScanIncomplete`:

- `findings`: what it found so far, in the call's return shape and offsets (`Match` for `findings()`,
  `(leaf, Match)` for `findings_by_leaf()`);
- `reason`: `"deadline"`;
- `read` (`findings_by_leaf()` only): the leaves whose findings in `findings` are complete. Their segment ran to its
  end. A copy of a string, and the nodes of a joined sentence whose sentence was not read, are not in it. A value
  found only in a leaf outside `read` is not spread into the leaves in it. `None` for `findings()`.

The text after the last finding is not scanned by every rule. A caller treats the rest as unscanned, for example
with its own patterns.

One rule's regex on one text cannot be interrupted, so a scan can pass its deadline by its slowest single step. A
`References` you give is asked during the work on each hit: a slow one adds its own time per hit, but past the
deadline only the hit in work still asks it (before 0.8.25 every hit of the running rule did).
Measured on the reference host (AMD EPYC 9645, 2026-11-05), five runs per budget of 0.05 to 1 s:

| Input | Whole scan | Time past the deadline |
|---|---:|---:|
| 1 MB tool text, `findings()` | 9.2 s | at most 109 ms, median 5 to 53 ms |
| Slack history of 88 KB JSON, `findings_by_leaf()` | 0.32 s | under 1 ms |

## A remote detector (optional)

The rules find few names (docs/NER-EXPERIMENT.md). A named-entity service can add them after the rules, through
`maisecrets/detection/remote.py`. It is off unless a caller gives one, and the entry point above never asks one: it
reads no network.

```python
from maisecrets.detection import remote

ner = remote.RemoteDetector("http://127.0.0.1:8765/", format="hf", model="d3-onnx-fp32@d421f57d", timeout=0.3)
result = detector.findings_with(text, channel="tool", remote=ner)
result.findings          # the findings of the rules as they are, and the spans of the service (Match.score set)
result.remote.state      # "ok", "unavailable" (result.remote.reason: timeout, refused, network, policy, http, answer), "too_long"
response = contract.result_response(detector, result)    # the same as JSON (maisecrets.detect/1)
```

- **Offsets** of the answer are code points of the text, as a Python service counts them (`str` indices). A service
  that counts UTF-16 units or bytes masks the wrong place after a character outside the BMP; the rules' findings
  stay, the name does not get masked.
- **Wire formats.** `hf`: Hugging Face token classification, `{"inputs": text}` in, `[{"entity_group" (or
  `entity`), "start", "end", "score"}]` out. `presidio`: Presidio Analyzer, `POST /analyze` with `{"text",
  "language"}`, `[{"entity_type", "start", "end", "score"}]` out. A label `B-PER` or `I-PER` counts as `PER`.
- **Classes.** `classes` maps a class of the service to a type of `types.json`. The default is `PER` and `PERSON` to
  `NAME`, the one class the NER experiment measured; an operator adds more (`{"LOC": "ADDRESS"}`). `min_score` sets
  the least score per type; there is none by default, and no threshold here was chosen from a benchmark.
- **A product name is no person.** A name span that `remote.is_product_name(span)` accepts (a word of
  `PRODUCT_WORDS` alone, or one followed only by words of `PRODUCT_WORDS` and `PRODUCT_TAILS`, as "Claude Code") is
  dropped, and so is a word of `GREETING_WORDS` alone. A caller that applies the spans itself calls the same function
  (since 0.8.15).
- **It only adds.** A span is kept only where no finding of the rules and no span kept before it lies. A finding of
  the rules is never removed, made smaller, moved or retyped. A span that ends inside a word is widened to the whole
  word.
- **The service never sees a finding of the rules.** Each one goes out as filler (`_`) of the same length, so the
  offsets of the answer fit the text. `mask=False` sends them as they are: the filler costs the model of the NER
  experiment 21 of 2,482 names on the V3 samples (docs/NER-EXPERIMENT.md, "The remote path"). The plugin allows it
  only for a service on loopback or a Unix socket.
- **A failing service changes nothing.** Slow (over `timeout`, or past the `deadline` of `findings_with`, one budget
  for several texts), refused, an HTTP error, or an answer with any item it cannot read: the findings of the rules
  alone, and `result.remote` says `unavailable` and why. A text longer than `max_chars` is not sent (`too_long`).
  Nothing of the service raises. A deadline that passes while the rules scan raises `ScanIncomplete`, as in
  `findings()` (since 0.9.4), and the service is not asked.
- **No network unless asked.** The URL must be a loopback address (127.0.0.0/8, `::1`, `localhost`) or a Unix socket
  (`unix:/path`), else `RemoteDetector` raises `ValueError`; `allow_network=True` allows any `http` or `https` host.
  A host name is looked up at each request: without `allow_network` every address must be loopback, and the
  connected peer is checked again before a byte is sent, so a `localhost` that a hosts file sends elsewhere is
  refused.
- **The deadline holds for the whole request.** Name lookup, connect, send and the answer run in a thread that the
  caller leaves at the deadline, so a service that sends its answer a byte at a time cannot hold the caller. A wrong
  setting (`classes`, `min_score`, `timeout`, `max_chars`) raises `ValueError` when the detector is made.
- **The model version is the operator's word.** Neither format names its model in the answer, so `model` is what the
  operator states, and `engine.remote.model` of a response is only as true as that setting. The reference service
  (`examples/ner_service.py`) reports its own at `GET /info`, so an operator can compare.
  Its model (D3) is AFL-3.0 and its base model Apache-2.0: an image that contains them keeps their notices
  (`docs/NER-EXPERIMENT.md`, "Licence of D3").
- **More classes than names.** `{"inputs": text}` asks the reference service for persons only. With
  `"parameters": {"labels": [...]}` it answers the spans of those classes, each with its class in `entity_group`; a
  class that `GET /info` does not list in `labels` is a 400. `RemoteDetector` sends the labels only with
  `ask_labels=True` (the Hugging Face API has no such parameter) and when `classes` maps a class beyond
  `PER`/`PERSON`, so any other service gets the request it always got. `GET /health` answers `{"status": "ok"}`. The image `mcpgate/ner` runs this service, and in the plugin `/maisecrets:ner` sets it
  up (README, "Names from a service").
- **In a response** (`contract.result_response`), a finding of the service has `score` and `provenance.origin` and
  `layer` `model`; `engine.remote` holds `format`, `model`, `state` and, when unavailable, `reason`. Without a
  remote detector the response is the one of the entry point. The schema has both fields as optional.

These names are **new and provisional**: `RemoteDetector`, `RemoteStatus`, `Result`, `Detector.findings_with`,
`contract.result_response` and `Match.score` (`None` for a finding of the rules). They are not in `__all__`; a
change to them goes into the changelog under "API" without a deprecation until a minor release makes them stable.
`tests/test_remote_detector.py` holds the points above against a fake service of each format.

## The old names

`maisecrets.detect` and `maisecrets.checksums`, `lazy_regex`, `normalise`, `regions`, `registry`, `rulespec`,
`rule_filter` and `personal` stay. Each is the same module object as its module in `maisecrets/detection/`, so an
import or a patch through an old name reaches the core itself. The plugin and its tests use them.
`detect.scan()`, `detect.findings()` and the other functions use the default detector, which `use_regions`,
`use_sources` and `use_references` configure.

## The boundary tests

| Test | It holds |
|---|---|
| `tests/test_detection_boundary.py` | No module outside the core uses a private name of the core, by any of its names. A plain scan imports only the plugin modules on a list that may only get shorter. |
| `tests/test_scan_context.py` | A scan writes no new module state; the state left is the per-thread text index and caches that depend on no configuration. |
| `tests/test_detector.py` | Two detectors, their caches, their threads and the snapshot of a rule load. |
| `tests/test_detector_host.py` | An explicit host reads neither the user name nor the clock; an explicit detector gives one result on two hosts. |
| `tests/test_detection_package.py` | The API, the old names, the rule data, and a library caller that imports nothing of the plugin. |
| `tests/test_code_point_offsets.py` | The offsets count code points: emoji and combining characters before, around and inside a value, in a JSON line and in the cleaned copy of a tool result. |
| `tests/test_detection_entry_point.py` | The JSON entry point: the conformance cases through it, the schema, the errors, the bytes of two runs, no value in any output. |
| `tests/test_detection_fields.py` | The `fields` argument: evidence as a label in text, nothing for a weak name, no hit taken away, the same hits on a JSON text the core parses itself, the `TypeError` and `ValueError` of a wrong shape. |
| `tests/test_library_consumer.py` | A server-like caller of the public names only (`examples/library_consumer.py`): its own sources and rules, `reset()`, two detectors in eight threads, a large input, many requests, no file under HOME. |

`scripts/detection_fingerprint.py` records the hits of 27,337 inputs. A change that moves the code and not the rules
leaves the fingerprint byte-identical.

## A language-neutral spec

`docs/DETECTION-SPEC-DRAFT.md` measures how far the core is from a spec that a second implementation could follow:
what is data today, what is Python, about 31 semantic primitives, and a case format that tells normative cases from
snapshot records. It is an analysis; nothing in the runtime depends on it.
