"""A generated matrix of inputs with known answers for the detector.

Each case combines a label, a separator, a value shape, what follows the value and the text
around it, and says exactly which span is the secret (and which is an e-mail address). The
cases are drawn from the full product with a fixed seed, so a run is reproducible and a
failure names its combination. Every value is generated here; nothing comes from real data.

Two cases found by hand on 2026-09-27 started it: `password:X and a@b.de` lost the password
(the value ran to the end of the line and was then rejected as prose), and
a password of two letters in turn after `password:` was taken for filler.
