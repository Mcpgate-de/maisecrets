"""Time checks that hold on a loaded machine.

A fixed bound on the time of a call (1.0 s of wall time, 3.0 s of CPU) failed in pipelines and on loaded machines
with no change to the code (2026-10-16). The claim of such a test is about how the time grows: a scan that grows with
the square of its text, or a wait per key. So a check here measures CPU time, not wall time (other processes slow the
clock, not the call), takes the fastest of a few calls of the small case (other processes only ever add to it), and
compares two sizes: 8 times the input is 8 times the time when the call is linear and 64 times when it is quadratic.
An absolute bound stays for a cost that does not grow with the input: 3 s of CPU by default (the calls here take at
most 115 ms at load 35), the 7 s watchdog of a hook for a call that takes over 0.5 s (Gate A review: a fixed cost of
8 s passed a check of the growth alone).

The slack holds several steps of the CPU clock of Windows (about 15.6 ms each). So a check of the growth sees a part
that grows with the square of the input only when that part takes about as long as the linear work at the large size,
and at least some 70 ms (Gate B review). The fixed bounds before were not stricter.
