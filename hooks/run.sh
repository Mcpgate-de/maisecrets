# One probe per candidate. It answers by its exit code only: 0 for 3.9 or newer, 60 + minor for an older 3, 50 + minor
# for a 2 (codes clear of 126 and 127 of the shell, 128 + n of a signal, and 9009 % 256 of a Windows store alias). A probe gets no descriptor of the hook: stdin, stdout and stderr are /dev/null, so a wrapper (a shim, a
# script that starts a job in the background) cannot eat the payload or hold the pipe that the client reads. Codex
# reads a hook until its stdout closes, and both clients let the call through when a hook runs past their timeout
# (measured on Claude Code 2.1.302 and codex-cli 0.162.0, docs/THREAT-MODEL.md, C13).
