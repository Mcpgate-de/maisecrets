rem Hook launcher for Windows without Git Bash. Codex runs the commandWindows entry of
rem hooks/hooks.json as   cmd.exe /C "<command>"   with the payload on stdin (codex-rs,
rem hooks/src/engine/command_runner.rs, read 2026-09-26). A batch file hands stdin to its
rem child untouched; a PowerShell launcher lost it (the host consumed the stream, measured
rem in the Windows matrix job). Same job as run.sh: find a Python 3.9+, run dispatch.py.
rem Fails closed: without Python each hook event gets the JSON refusal of its client and exit 0,
rem as from run.sh (exit 2 blocked in Claude Code only; Codex runs the tool on a failed hook).
rem Usage: run.cmd <user-prompt|pre-tool|post-tool|session-start>

set "HERE=%~dp0"
rem One line per start, overwritten: when a hook does not act, this says whether the client started it and with
rem which environment. Codex clears the environment of a hook and replays a snapshot (codex-rs command_runner.rs);
rem on one Windows machine no hook acted with Python installed (2026-09-30). Names and paths only, never a payload.

rem inherits the hook's pipe handles on Windows (codex code review, round 3), and the home is another, configured
